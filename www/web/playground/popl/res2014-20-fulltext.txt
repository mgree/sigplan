years of research and development around coq huet inria paris ­ france inria paris ­ france the coq proof assistant is an interactive software system based on higherorder type theory designed and implemented by a team of researchers as a continuous effort over the last years it implements a logical framework called the calculus of inductive constructions with notational facilities and a modular structure allowing its use as a highlevel language fit for the development of compositional mathematical components explicit potential proof structures are built by execution of ml tactics and along a choice of proof schemes combinators this allows a wide of inference from inference to full decision procedures and reflection principles the validity of such a potential proof is verified by an independent core proof checker whose metatheory has been itself formally justified coq proofs may be seen as programs in a highlevel functional notation by correctness assertions and into existing programming languages such as ocaml and haskell are available conversely specialized allow the development of algorithms with logical assertions whose validity is checked by coq the coq proof assistant an software development is in use by a large community of users some have been achieved in formalized mathematics color theorem odd order theorem as well as in software certification java processing environment compcert verification of c compiling checked by coq the coq proof assistant an software development is in use by a large community of users some have been achieved in formalized mathematics the color theorem the odd order theorem in group theory as well as in software certification a java processing environment the compcert certified c compiling project the talk will have two parts first huet will the of coq its roots in early type theory through the influence of per dependent type theory polymorphic calculi f and f de languages and and the effort of robin milner and at the university of edinburgh he will discuss the behind a few design decisions and briefly the in the s and s will then address a of issues related to the logical status of equality the proof methods the highlevel specification language the user interfaces permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page for components of this work must be for all other uses the popl january ­ san diego ca usa copyright is held by the acm
