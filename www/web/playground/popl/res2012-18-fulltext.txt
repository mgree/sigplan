programming languages for networks princeton university abstract computer networks perform a array of tasks from routing and access control to traffic monitoring and load to support users accessing services in the and networks are under increasing to support client mobility migration resource isolation between services and operation yet network must the network through closed and interfaces to heterogeneous devices such as switches load network address and detection systems not surprisingly these complex networks is expensive and and in network management proceeds at a during the past several years the and research community have pushed for greater in software and a separation between devices and the software that them this broad is known as software defined sdn a of sdn is having an open interface for controller software running on a computer to rules in the underlying switches in particular the protocol see has significant many commercial switches support and a number of and networks have the new technology with the of open interfaces to network devices the time is to the design of network software to put on a stronger foundation and foster in services the programming languages community can play a role in this transformation by creating languages compilers runtime systems and testing and verification techniques that raise the level of abstraction for programming the network in this talk we give an overview of software defined and survey the early research in this area we also outline opportunities for research at the intersection of programming languages and computer networks categories and subject descriptors c networks network architecture and design d programming languages general general terms design languages keywords software defined network protocols copyright is held by the popl january ­ pa usa acm
