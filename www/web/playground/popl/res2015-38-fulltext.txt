databases and programming two divided by a common language peter university of edinburgh abstract the s saw a interaction between database and programming language research ideas about type systems from programming languages a central role in generalizing and relational database systems to new data models at the same time databases provided some of the best concrete examples of the application of concurrency theory and of the benefits of highlevel optimization in functional programming languages one of the behind this research was the idea that database access should be properly embedded in programming languages one should not have to be in order to use a database from a programming language and that goal has to some extent been realized in the past years new data models both for data storage and for data exchange have appeared with and with each such model the query language does programming language research have anything to contribute to these new languages should we take the time to to about embedding these models in conventional languages over the same period some interesting new connections between databases and programming languages have notably in the areas of scientific databases annotation and provenance will this provide new opportunities for acm classification d programming languages h database management peter is of database systems at the university of edinburgh his work in computer science has focused mainly on databases and programming languages specifically active databases database semantics approximate information query languages types for databases data integration and data he has recently on issues associated with scientific and databases such as data provenance and annotation he has on numerous and working groups and has been for acm acm and he is a of the of london and edinburgh a of the acm and the of a society before joining the university of edinburgh was a at the department of computer and information science at the university of pennsylvania he received his degree from cambridge university his degree from the university of and he did work at the university of edinburgh he has held positions at the university of glasgow college university and inria in addition to computer science he has made contributions to graph theory to the mathematics of recently he has to build systems for the of permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page for components of this work must be for all other uses the copyright is held by the popl january ­ acm
