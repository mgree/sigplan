coding by every peter lee microsoft research abstract in recent years advances in machine learning and related fields have led to significant advances in a range of including processing recognition and natural language processing these advances in turn have enabled digital and translation systems to become practical to on a large scale in essence machines are capable of what we are saying but will they understand what we want them to do when we talk to them what are the for getting useful work done ­ in essence by synthesizing programs ­ through the act of having a conversation with a computer in this lecture i will on the central role that design and program synthesis may have in this possible ­ and i will argue likely ­ future of computing one in which every user writes programs every by with a computing system acm classification d automatic programming i automatic synthesis author keywords natural user interaction digital dr peter lee is vice microsoft research he research operations and over researchers and support to the state of the art in computing and creating new for products and services prior to joining microsoft lee held key positions in both and most recently at the advanced research projects where he and directed a major technology that supported research in computing and related areas in the and physical sciences prior to lee as head of carnegie mellon computer science department he also as the vice for research lee has shown in research spanning and he is a of the association for computing machinery and serves the research community at the national level including policy contributions to the of on science and technology and membership on both the national research computer science and and the of the computer and information science and engineering of the national science foundation he was the former of the computing research association and has before both the us science and technology and the us lee holds a phd in computer and communication sciences from the university of at ann and in mathematics and computer sciences also from the university of at ann permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page for components of this work must be for all other uses the copyright is held by the popl january ­ acm
