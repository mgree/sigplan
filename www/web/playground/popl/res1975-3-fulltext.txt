some optimization techniques for an extensible language christopher cambridge mass abstract cs is an extensible language currently being developed for the the language design was strongly by and algol some of the more important aspects of cs are as follows cs has strong type checking and a rich data definition facility mode generators include array structure pointer status and set procedures can be defined as and can be used as prefix or infix operators procedures can be compiletime to be invoked during program compilation cs provides a complete set of structured controlflow similar to those in the access statement allows separately compiled modules to communicate via a strongly checked interface complete attribute information concerning the accessed modules is thus available to the accessing modules including any optimization properties to the accessed functions work is currently in progress on the design of a compiler for cs ultimately to be written in cs early in the development it apparent that a practical optimizer was important because of the similarity of control structure in cs and the compiler was studied with the intention of and improving their global optimization strategies this paper presents some of the results of this study the main one of which is a set of new optimization techniques which defer control and data until the information is actually required such a scheme is necessary for in compilers such as in which the intermediate representation of a program is not i this development was directed center san diego california by the under laboratory contract
