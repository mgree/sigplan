Pierce t At POPL 1994, we \npresented a paper on Decidable Bounded Quantification [CP94]. Sadly, subsequent discussion on the Types \nmailing list [G94,P94] has re\u00advealed that, while strictly speaking our stated results were correct, the \ncentral idea was fundamentally flawed. System F<, the second-order A-calculus of bounded quantificatio~, \nwas invented by Cardelli and Wegner (see [CP94] for background and references). The stand\u00adard formulation, \ndue to Curien and Ghelli, includes the following rule for comparing polymorphic types: This rule turns \nout to be responsible for the loss of numerous desirable syntactic properties, including the decidability \nof the subtyping relation. In [CP94], we proposed to replace it by the following simpler rule, 17}TI<SI \nr, X< Top } S2 < T2 (v-top) r b V(XS S1)S2 < V(X< T1)T2 and proved that the resulting subtyping relation \nsatisfies many desirable properties. Since difficulties with F< are traditionally associated with the \nsubtyping relatio~, we assumed that the usual, straightforward treatment of the typing relation would \ncarry over. It does not, The new system lacks the minimal typing property, i.e., the set of all types \ninhabited by a given term may not contain a least element. This can be seen by the following example, \ndue to Ghelli. Let a be the term s AX< Y. Ax:X, x. One can prove that a has both the type V(X< Y) X+X \nand the type V(X< Y)X+Y. But these types are incomparable and have no common lower bound. An immediate \nconsequence is that the standard typing algorithm for the new calculus (the same as for F<, but using \nthe new subtype relation) *LIENS(CNRS) 45, rue d Ulm Paris, France tLFCS, Univ. of Edinburgh.

One might also consider redefining \nthe typechecking relation so that only the first type for a is allowed effectively establishing completeness \nof the typeing algorithm by fiat; but this loses subject reduction. The decidability of typechecking \nfor F< with V-top remains an open problem. But even if the system were decidable (for example, by an \nalgorithm comput\u00ading finite sets of minimal types), it seems unlikely that such an algorithm could be \nacceptably efficient. Con\u00adsider the contexts r = . . . ,D<C-+C, B< C,A<B and l_ = . . .. D<c-+C. B< C, \nA< Top. The~ub\u00adtyping statement D < A+C is provable under 17, but not under I . It follows that an algorithm \nthat com\u00adputes a complete set of minimal types for a term like AAs B. Ax:D. x by breaking the link between \nA and its bound B must consider promoting D to C~C and then further promoting the result, even though \nD ap\u00adpears quite some distance from A in the context and, worse yet, even though the binding of D is \nbefore A s binding. This example suggests that the sets of min\u00adimal types of a term may be very large. \nAt the moment, we see two choices for calculi with bounded quantification: (1) to embrace F< and learn \nto live with its difficulties; or (2) to return to Cardelli and Wegner s original formulation, sometimes \ncalled Kernel Fun, which used another, slightly odd-looking but bet\u00adter behaved restriction of the quantifier \nrule: r,x<uts2<T2 (V-Fun) r t-V(x< U)S2 < V(x< U)T2 [CP94] Giuseppe Castagna and Benjamin Pierce.
