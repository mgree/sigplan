Students can register for courses, and can navigate through personalized views of course material. Atlas has been built according to Sun Microsystem's Java#8482; Servlet specification using Xerox PARC's aspect-oriented programming support called Aspect#8482;. Since aspect-oriented programming is still in its infancy, little experience with employing this paradigm is currently available. In this paper, we start filling this gap by describing the aspects we used in Atlas and by discussing the effect of aspects on our object-oriented development practices. We describe some rules and policies that we employed to achieve our goals of maintainability and modifiability, and introduce a straightforward notation to express the design of aspects. Although we faced some obstacles along the way, this combination of technology helped us build a fast, well-structured system in a reasonable amount of time.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Mik Kersten", "author_profile_id": "81341492451", "affiliation": "University of British Columbia, 2366 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada", "person_id": "PP31084380", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Gail C.
