Traversals are traditionally specified as iterations, forcing the programmer to adopt an imperative style, or are hard-coded into the program or visitor. Our proposal allows a number of problems best approached by recursive means to be tackled with the visitor pattern, while retaining the benefits of a separate traversal specification.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Johan Ovlinger", "author_profile_id": "81100143061", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA", "person_id": "PP31091737", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Mitchell Wand", "author_profile_id": "81100072594", "affiliation": "College of Computer Science, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA", "person_id": "PP39025873", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/320384.320391", "year": "1999", "article_id": "320391", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "A language for specifying recursive traversals of object structures", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=320391"}
