Unless implemented with utmost care, synchronization can become a performance bottleneck. Furthermore, in languages where every object may have its own monitor, per-object space overhead must be minimized. To address these concerns, we have developed a meta-lock to mediate access to synchronization data. The meta-lock is fast (lock + unlock executes in 11 SPARC#8482; architecture instructions), compact (uses only two bits of space), robust under contention (no busy-waiting), and flexible (supports a variety of higher-level synchronization operations). We have validated the meta-lock with an implementation of the synchronization operations in a high-performance product-quality Java#8482; virtual machine and report performance data for several large programs.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Ole Agesen", "author_profile_id": "81100428004", "affiliation": "Sun Microsystems Laboratories, One Network Drive, Burlington, MA", "person_id": "PP18001641", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "David Detlefs", "author_profile_id": "81100499495", "affiliation": "Sun Microsystems Laboratories, One Network Drive, Burlington, MA", "person_id": "P61233", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Alex Garthwaite", "author_profile_id": "81100171716", "affiliation": "Sun Microsystems Laboratories, One Network Drive, Burlington, MA", "person_id": "PP14070341", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ross Knippel", "author_profile_id": "81100493743", "affiliation": "Sun Microsystems, 901 San Antonio Road, Palo Alto, CA", "person_id": "PP31082790", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Y.
