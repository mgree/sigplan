This analysis propagates precise type information about the contents of container objects. As an application, the analysis can be used to justify the safe removal of downcasts that are guaranteed to succeed. Another application is in automatically reverse engineering parameterized types into existing Java libraries, so that they can be used in Java dialects with parameterized types.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Dominic Duggan", "author_profile_id": "81100303097", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey", "person_id": "P67811", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/320384.320393", "year": "1999", "article_id": "320393", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Modular type-based reverse engineering of parameterized types in Java code", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=320393"}
