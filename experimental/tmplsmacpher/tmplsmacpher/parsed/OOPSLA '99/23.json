In particular, it compares object-oriented and aspect-oriented designs and implementations of role models.</p><p>Sections 1, 2, and 3 provide background information on role models, object-oriented role model implementations, and aspect-oriented programming, respectively. New aspect-oriented designs for role models are explored in sections 4, 5, and 6.</p><p>The base reference for this exploration is the Role Object pattern. Although useful for role models, this pattern introduces some problems at the implementation level, namely object schizophrenia, significant interface maintenance, and no support for role composition. Our research has resulted in alternative aspect-oriented designs that alleviate some of these problems.</p><p>Section 7 discusses how an agent framework that implements role models has been partially reengineered with aspects. The reengineering addressed concerns that are orthogonal or cross cut both the core and the role behavior. The aspect oriented redesign significantly reduced code tangling, overall method and module count, and total lines of code. These results and other conclusions are presented in section 8.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Elizabeth A.
