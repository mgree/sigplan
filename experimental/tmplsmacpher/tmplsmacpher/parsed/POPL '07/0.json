Abstract \nPerl is a general-purpose language, known for its vast number of freely available libraries. The Perl \n6 project was started to improve the language s support for multi-paradigmatic programming, while retaining \ncompatibility with the existing code base. This talk discusses how Perl 6 attempts to reconcile various \ncompeting paradigms in the field of programming language design, such as static vs. dynamic typechecking, \nnominal vs. structural subtyping, prototype vs. class-based objects, and lazy vs. eager evaluation. Moreover, \nthis talk also covers the design and development of Pugs, a self\u00adhosting Perl 6 implementation bootstrapped \nfrom Haskell, targeting multiple runtime environments, including Perl 5, JavaScript and Parrot.
