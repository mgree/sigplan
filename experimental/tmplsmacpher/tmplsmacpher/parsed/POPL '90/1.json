It is optimal in the sense defined by L&#233;vy. The basis of the algorithm is a graphical representation of the kinds of commonality that can arise from substitutions; the idea can be adapted to represent other kinds of expressions besides lambda expressions. The algorithm is also well suited to parallel implementations, consisting of a fixed set of local graph rewrite rules.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "John Lamping", "author_profile_id": "81100154625", "affiliation": "Xerox PARC", "person_id": "PP39030025", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/96709.96711", "year": "1990", "article_id": "96711", "conference": "POPL", "title": "An algorithm for optimal lambda calculus reduction", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=96711"}
