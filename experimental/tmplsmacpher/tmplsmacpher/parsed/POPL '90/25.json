Specifically, we show that for the class of &#8220;oraclizable&#8221; networks a semantic model in which networks are represented by certain sets of continuous functions is fully abstract and has the fixed-point property. We go on to show that the oraclizable networks are the largest class representable by this model, and are a proper superclass of the networks implementable with the <italic>infinity fair merge</italic> primitive. Finally, we use this characterization to show that infinity fair merge networks and oraclizable networks are proper subclasses of the networks with Egli-Milner monotone input-output relations.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "James R.
