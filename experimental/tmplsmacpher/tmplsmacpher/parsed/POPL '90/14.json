Unlike previous incremental iterative methods, this incremental algorithm efficiently computes <italic>precise</italic> and <italic>correct</italic> solutions. We give theoretical results on the imprecision of <italic>restarting iteration</italic> for incremental update by fixed point iteration which provided motivation for our algorithm design. Described intuitively, the main algorithm idea is to factor the data flow solution on strong connected components of the flow graph into local and external parts, solving for the local parts by iteration and propagating these effects on the condensation of the flow graph to obtain the entire data flow solution. The incremental hybrid algorithm re-performs those algorithm steps affected by the program changes.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas J.
