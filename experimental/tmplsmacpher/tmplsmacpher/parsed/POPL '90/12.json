The goal is validate program transformations that introduce imperative constructs such as destructive updatings, stack allocations and explicit deallocations in order to reduce the run-time memory management overhead. Our method is based on an operational model of higher order functional programs from which we construct statically computable abstractions using the abstract interpretation framework. Our method provides a solution to a problem left open [Hudak 86]: determining isolation of data in the case of higher order languages with structured data.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Alan Deutsch", "author_profile_id": "81332495993", "affiliation": "ICSLA Team, Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Ecole Polytechnique (LIX), 91128 Palaiseau Cedex - France", "person_id": "P12371", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/96709.96725", "year": "1990", "article_id": "96725", "conference": "POPL", "title": "On determining lifetime and aliasing of dynamically allocated data in higher-order functional specifications", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=96725"}
