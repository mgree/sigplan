{"article_publication_date": "12-01-1989", "fulltext": "\n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "96709", "abstract": "<p>An instruction or a set of instructions can be considered time critical if their execution is required to free up a resource. Time critical instructions might be used to make shared resources such as registers more quickly available for reuse; or they might be used for real time computations, portions of which are critical for the operation of some piece of equipment. In this paper we present a polynomial time algorithm for optimally scheduling instructions with or without time critical constraints on RISC machines such as the IBM 801, the Berkeley RISC machine, and the HP Precision Architecture. We also show that in the absence of time critical constraints, the greedy algorithm always produces a schedule for a target machine with multiple identical pipelines that has a length less than twice that of an optimal schedule. The behavior of the greedy algorithm is of interest because, as we show, the instruction scheduling problem becomes NP-hard for arbitrary length pipelines, even when the basic block of code being input consists of only several independent streams of straight-line code, and there are no time-critical constraints. Finally, we present the first correct proofs that the problem becomes NP-hard even for small pipelines, no time-critical constraints, and input of several independent streams of straight-line code if there is only a single register or if there is a bus constraint.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Krishna Palem", "author_profile_id": "81100645498", "affiliation": "IBM Research Division, T.J.
