Such approximations, often called types, are not known to be recursive. In this paper, we use Cartesian closure to define a similar, but more accurate, approximation. The main result proves that our approximation is not only recursive, but that it can be finitely represented in the form of a cyclic term graph. This explicit representation can be used as a starting point for logic program analyzers.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Nevin Heintze", "author_profile_id": "81100251839", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA", "person_id": "P208265", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Joxan Jaffar", "author_profile_id": "81100285914", "affiliation": "IBM T.
