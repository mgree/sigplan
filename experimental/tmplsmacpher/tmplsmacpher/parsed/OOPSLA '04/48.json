Often, these techniques rely on formal methods and sophisticated program analysis. While these techniques are valuable, they can be difficult to apply, and they aren't always effective in finding real bugs.</p> <p>&#60;i>Bug patterns&#60;/i> are code idioms that are often errors. We have implemented automatic detectors for a variety of bug patterns found in Java programs. In this extended abstract&#60;sup>1&#60;/sup>, we describe how we have used bug pattern detectors to find serious bugs in several widely used Java applications and libraries. We have found that the effort required to implement a bug pattern detector tends to be low, and that even extremely simple detectors find bugs in real applications.</p> <p>From our experience applying bug pattern detectors to real programs, we have drawn several interesting conclusions. First, we have found that even well tested code written by experts contains a surprising number of obvious bugs. Second, Java (and similar languages) have many language features and APIs which are prone to misuse. Finally, that simple automatic techniques can be effective at countering the impact of both ordinary mistakes and misunderstood language features.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "David Hovemeyer", "author_profile_id": "81100105814", "affiliation": "University of Maryland, College Park, MD", "person_id": "P452064", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "William Pugh", "author_profile_id": "81100057068", "affiliation": "University of Maryland, College Park, MD", "person_id": "PP15020758", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028717", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028717", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Finding bugs is easy", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028717"}
