The key for achieving scalable and maintainable distributed systems is dependability, because otherwise the complexity of distribution would leave the system uncontrollable. Hence, our approach aims at a concept for optimizing dependability. Similar to other approaches we use replication as means to provide transparent fault-tolerance and persistence, but we especially focus on increasing availability by relaxing data integrity by using a mixture of asynchronous and synchronous replication techniques. This work contributes three main aspects: First, a description of the envisioned trade-off between availability and consistency, secondly with a mechanism to achieve this trade-off, and thirdly, with models that use this mechanism and can be transparently deployed by developers. This work aims at enabling a configurable and application-specific optimum of availability, possibly even controlled during runtime. A real-life telecommunication application serves as proof of concept.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "A.
