It also enables the assignment of blame in error reporting. As of yet, no AOP implementation for the provision of DBC exists. We present an aspect-oriented DBC tool for Java named &#60;i>Cona&#60;/i>. We also extend the use of DBC and assertions to AOP. Aspects are used in the implementation of contracts, and contracts are used for enforcing assertions on aspects.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Therapon Skotiniotis", "author_profile_id": "81100227543", "affiliation": "Northeastern University, Boston, MA", "person_id": "P508143", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "David H.
