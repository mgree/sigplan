Our system analyses existing Java programs, acquires relationships among classes, and extracts JavaBeans components composed of classes. Moreover, our system generates indexes composed of divided type names and comments for newly extracted components. Using our system, the extracted components can be searched by keywords, and the result set can be viewed by a web browser such that the user can decide whether the query result component matches his/her requirements.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Hironori Washizaki", "author_profile_id": "81100467449", "affiliation": "National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan", "person_id": "PP14163278", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Yoshiaki Fukazawa", "author_profile_id": "81100273435", "affiliation": "Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan", "person_id": "P306461", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028749", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028749", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "A search system for java programs by using extracted javaBeans components", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028749"}
