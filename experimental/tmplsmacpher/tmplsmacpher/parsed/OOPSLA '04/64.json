We present a detailed case study showing that linking microprocessor-level performance characteristics to the source code is helpful for identifying performance bottlenecks and their causes. In addition, we relate our work to a previously proposed time-based HPM profiling framework.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Dries Buytaert", "author_profile_id": "81100468396", "affiliation": "Ghent University, Gent, Belgium", "person_id": "P698113", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Andy Georges", "author_profile_id": "81100487568", "affiliation": "Ghent University, Gent, Belgium", "person_id": "P643379", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Lieven Eeckhout", "author_profile_id": "81330490198", "affiliation": "Ghent University, Gent, Belgium", "person_id": "PP45025842", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Koen De Bosschere", "author_profile_id": "81100123309", "affiliation": "Ghent University, Gent, Belgium", "person_id": "PP14054039", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028735", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028735", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Bottleneck analysis in java applications using hardware performance monitors", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028735"}
