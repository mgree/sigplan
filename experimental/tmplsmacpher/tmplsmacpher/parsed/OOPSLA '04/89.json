To enable systematic development and maintenance, related models need to be kept synchronized. In order to establish and maintain consistency, we need to precisely define what it means for two models to be synchronized. In this paper, we present our view of model synchronization as a problem of maximizing model dependencies. Our conceptual view of software models is as graphs, and model transformations are viewed in terms of basic graph transformations such as node insertions and deletions. Based on this view, a set of transformations applied to one model is traced and propagated to the other by choosing, from a set of possible transformation paths, a path that maximizes underlying model dependencies.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Igor Ivkovic", "author_profile_id": "81100227910", "affiliation": "University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada", "person_id": "PP17000702", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Kostas Kontogiannis", "author_profile_id": "81100496122", "affiliation": "Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece", "person_id": "PP39045640", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028760", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028760", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Model synchronization as a problem of maximizing model dependencies", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028760"}
