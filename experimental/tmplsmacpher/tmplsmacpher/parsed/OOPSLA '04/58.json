The advantages of this approach mainly result from the usage of creational design patterns, reflection and dynamic loading, and representation independence. These introduce significant flexibility and abstraction. Using this library, we may work with abstract algebraic structures, such as: groups, rings, fields, etc., define new algebraic structures, and operate with them in abstract and concrete mathematical ways.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Virginia Niculescu", "author_profile_id": "81100326576", "affiliation": "Babe&#351;-Bolyai University", "person_id": "PP40026082", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Grigoreta Moldovan", "author_profile_id": "81333488112", "affiliation": "Babe&#351;-Bolyai University", "person_id": "P4010446", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028729", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028729", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "OOLACA: an object oriented library for abstract and computational algebra", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028729"}
