Outsourcing and global development affect many things in our work environment: what and where we build, how (and when) we communicate, and how we prepare ourselves for the future.</p> <p>Outsourcing and global development inherently create challenges with long-distance communication, cultural differences, and crossing organizational boundaries. For example, how do software interface contracts help or hinder system integration? How can a team in one country extend or maintain software built by developers in another country?</p> <p>This Panel will appeal to anyone whose job is affected by outsourcing and globalization. Panelists will present and discuss both social and technical issues.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Steven Fraser", "author_profile_id": "81339499863", "affiliation": "Independent Consultant", "person_id": "PP39039573", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Lougie Anderson", "author_profile_id": "81544696956", "affiliation": "Sabrix", "person_id": "PP308795600", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ron Crocker", "author_profile_id": "81100461016", "affiliation": "Motorola", "person_id": "P248645", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Richard Gabriel", "author_profile_id": "81100654724", "affiliation": "Sun Microsystems", "person_id": "PP14224317", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Martin Fowler", "author_profile_id": "81100062314", "affiliation": "ThoughtWorks", "person_id": "PP31025357", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ricardo Lopez", "author_profile_id": "81339514579", "affiliation": "Qualcomm", "person_id": "PP14214116", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Dave Thomas", "author_profile_id": "81100412131", "affiliation": "Bedarra", "person_id": "PP43119689", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028722", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028722", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Challenges in outsourcing and global development: how will your job change?", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028722"}
