The system is built on a programming language where the user expresses equality constraints between types and the type checker then enforces these constraints. This simple extension to the type system allows the programmer to describe properties of his program in the types of witness objects which can be thought of as concrete evidence that the program has the property desired. These techniques and two other rich typing mechanisms, rank-N polymorphism and extensible kinds, create a powerful new programming idiom for writing programs whose types enforce semantic properties. This kind of synthesis between a practical programming language &#60;i>and&#60;/i> a logic creates a foundation for the design of languages of the future.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Tim Sheard", "author_profile_id": "81331504269", "affiliation": "Oregon Health & Science University", "person_id": "PP43124236", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028711", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028711", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Languages of the future", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028711"}
