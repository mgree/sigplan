This paper describes our experience in the definition of an aspect-oriented generative approach for the context of multi-agent systems. Our generative approach is composed of: (i) a domain-specific language called Agent-DSL, which allows to model crosscutting and non-crosscuting agent features; (ii) an aspect-oriented architecture that models a family of software agents; and (iii) a code generator that maps abstractions of the Agent-DSL to specific compositions of objects and aspects in specific implementations of agent architectures. The use of aspect-oriented techniques in the definition of our generative approach brought benefits to the modeling and code generation of crosscutting features since early design stages.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Uir&#225; Kulesza", "author_profile_id": "81100186619", "affiliation": "PUC-Rio, Brazil", "person_id": "P698178", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Alessandro Garcia", "author_profile_id": "81100379422", "affiliation": "PUC-Rio, Brazil", "person_id": "PP14134272", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Carlos Lucena", "author_profile_id": "81100332255", "affiliation": "PUC-Rio, Brazil", "person_id": "PP15029367", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028732", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028732", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "An aspect-oriented generative approach", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028732"}
