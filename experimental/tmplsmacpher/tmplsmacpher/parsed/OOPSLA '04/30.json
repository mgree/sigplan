In order to address these issues, the MDA-compliant Enterprise Fondue method proposes a hierarchy of UML profiles as a means for addressing middleware-specific concerns at different MDA-levels of abstraction, along with model transformations to incrementally refine existing design models according to the proposed profiles. Tool support is provided through the Parallax framework, which enables developers to modularize crosscutting concerns into aspectpromoting Eclipse plug-ins.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Raul Silaghi", "author_profile_id": "81100243829", "affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Lausanne EPFL, Switzerland", "person_id": "P489346", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028697", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028697", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Refining designs along middleware-specific concern-dimensions at different MDA-levels of abstraction", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028697"}
