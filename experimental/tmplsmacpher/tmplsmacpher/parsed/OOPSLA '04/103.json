In this work, we utilize next-time free linear-time temporal logic (LTL\\textbackslash X) as formal framework. The discipline serves the purpose of asserting certain design-time assumptions about object-oriented (OO) entities such as objects, methods, and so forth. In this paper we propose a linear-time logic over joinpoints \\citeLaddad03AspectJ, and introduce a lightweight runtime veri\\-fication tool based on this logic, J2SE 5 metadata \\citeJSR175 and an AspectJ-based \\citeAspectJ runtime backend. Implementations have been proposed so far for imperative and functional languages \\citeHuchStolz04a. To our knowledge our approach is the first to allow addressing of entire sets of states, also over subclass boundaries, thus exploiting the OO nature.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Eric Bodden", "author_profile_id": "81100018194", "affiliation": "RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany", "person_id": "PP39023425", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028776", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028776", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "A lightweight LTL runtime verification tool for java", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028776"}
