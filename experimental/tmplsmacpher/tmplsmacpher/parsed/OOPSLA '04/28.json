In particular, the set of correctness rules that guarantee the absence of data races will be refined and formalized; an augmented type system will be proposed to enforce these rules at compile time. Furthermore, an efficient methodology for deadlock prevention, avoidance, detection, and resolution will be developed. A working implementation of SCOOP will be provided. It will take into consideration the proposed mechanisms and serve as a basis for further refinements of the model.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Piotr Nienaltowski", "author_profile_id": "81100575072", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland", "person_id": "P517641", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028695", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028695", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Efficient data race and deadlock prevention in concurrent object-oriented programs", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028695"}
