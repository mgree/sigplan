Pragmatic quality has been improved in the literature through schema transformations. We suggest an approach that also improves the semantic quality by schema transformations. A semantic quality parameter 'extent of normalization' is defined. Based on this parameter and functional dependencies from problem domain, a set of rules is suggested to improve a given conceptual model. We also show that relational schema produced after these transformations is normalized up to 3NF at least.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Tauqeer Hussain", "author_profile_id": "81100480478", "affiliation": "LUMS, DHA, Lahore, Pakistan", "person_id": "P698174", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Shafay Shamail", "author_profile_id": "81100459088", "affiliation": "LUMS, DHA, Lahore, Pakistan", "person_id": "P262428", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Mian M.
