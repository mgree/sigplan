It is therefore reasonable to have a framework for constructing this kind of applications that can manage a graph structure. Nebras Graph Management Framework (NGMF) is a layered client-server framework for rapid development of these applications. This framework allows developers to construct different applications that deal with a network of nodes and edges. For example a CASE tool that handles UML class diagrams, a subject manager (an application for business entity classification) or a system for managing hierarchal lists of all product components (Bill Of Materials or BOM) are some cases that can be designed through applying our proposed framework.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Hadi Salimi", "author_profile_id": "81100374566", "affiliation": "Nebras Informatics Co., Tehran, IRAN", "person_id": "P698123", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028777", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028777", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "NGMF: a generic framework for constructing graph-based systems", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028777"}
