We show how CoSMIC addresses crosscutting configuration and deployment concerns at multiple layers of middleware and applications in component-based DRE systems. We also discuss how CoSMIC leverages model checking and analysis tools to validate key properties for configured DRE systems.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Aniruddha Gokhale", "author_profile_id": "81100340043", "affiliation": "Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN", "person_id": "P19178", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Krishnakumar Balasubramanian", "author_profile_id": "81100342735", "affiliation": "Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN", "person_id": "P698135", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Tao Lu", "author_profile_id": "81538501556", "affiliation": "Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN", "person_id": "PP14029443", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028758", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028758", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "CoSMIC: addressing crosscutting deployment and configuration concerns of distributed real-time and embedded systems", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028758"}
