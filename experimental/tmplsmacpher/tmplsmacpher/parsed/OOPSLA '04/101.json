Wells Fargo continued to improve upon its distributed applications technology leadership by launching a Model Driven Architecture [MDA] initiative in 1999. The technology provided a consistent middle-tier for retail applications such as the award-winning Wells Internet Bank and various phone-bank applications.</p> <p>Between 2001 and 2003 the original CORBA-based solution was completely replaced with new Web-Services-based distributed applications. This report contrasts the past and the present approach to such applications and discusses the lessons learned while transitioning from CORBA-based \"Service Oriented Architecture\" to one based on Web-Services.</p> <p>The final section of this report utilizes lessons learned from using CORBA & Web-Services for Intranet applications and proposes the \"application transparent distribution\" as a potential paradigm shift which may lead to radically faster and more efficient distributed application development.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Joachim F.
