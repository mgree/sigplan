Traits had previously been used to refactor the Smalltalk collection hierarchy, but only by the creators of traits themselves. This experience report represents the first independent test of these language features. Murphy-Hill implemented a substantialmulti-class data structure called ropes that makes significant use of traits. We found that traits improved understandability and reduced the number of methods that needed to be written by 46%.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Emerson R.
