This brief summary presents two research objectives for supporting software evolution in MDSD. First, the concept of model-driven program transformation is introduced to support evolution of large legacy software systems. The second research objective that is presented involves the application of a mature program transformation engine to automate model interpreter evolution in the presence of meta-model schema changes.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Jing Zhang", "author_profile_id": "81100124224", "affiliation": "University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL", "person_id": "PP15023359", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028778", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028778", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Supporting software evolution through model-driven program transformation", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028778"}
