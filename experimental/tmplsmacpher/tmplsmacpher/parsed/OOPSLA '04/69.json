The model can be harmonized with proprietary development methodologies by means of metamodeling and serves as the starting point for the traceability of requirements, global plausibility checks, and (semi-)automatic transformation of model elements. Based on the &#60;i>medini&#60;/i> tool chain, the model infrastructure is open with respect to the models and tools used thanks to the consistent deployment of OMG standards and the benefit of metamodeling.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Gabriel V&#246;gler", "author_profile_id": "81100072325", "affiliation": "DaimlerChrysler AG, Ulm, Germany", "person_id": "P698121", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Thomas Flor", "author_profile_id": "81100143173", "affiliation": "DaimlerChrysler AG, Ulm, Germany", "person_id": "P643490", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Hajo Eichler", "author_profile_id": "81436598238", "affiliation": "Fraunhofer Institute FOJUS, Berlin, Germany", "person_id": "P698125", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Matthias Kasprowicz", "author_profile_id": "81100314591", "affiliation": "FH Furtwangen, Germany", "person_id": "P698148", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028740", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028740", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "An open model infrastructure for automotive software", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028740"}
