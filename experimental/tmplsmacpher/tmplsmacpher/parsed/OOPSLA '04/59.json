Given the interface of an object required by a class-under-test, a Pseudo-Class is created implementing all methods such that they immediately fail. A test-specific sub-class of the Pseudo-Class is created locally in the test (ex. as an anonymous inner-class in Java), over-riding only the methods required by the interaction between the object and the class-under-test for the test-scenario. Typically, the method implementations are extremely simple (a few lines, at most), and the number of methods overridden is small. This mechanism was found adequate for more than 90% of our unit-tests (in a 1000-class system with over 2000 test methods, we finally ended up with about four real MockObject classes and more than 40 Pseudo-Classes).</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Geoff Sobering", "author_profile_id": "81100308344", "affiliation": "Isthmus Group, Madison, WI", "person_id": "P698122", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Levi Cook", "author_profile_id": "81537971256", "affiliation": "Isthmus Group, Madison, WI", "person_id": "PP308894700", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Steve Anderson", "author_profile_id": "81547729156", "affiliation": "Berbee, Madison, WI", "person_id": "PP15021977", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028730", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028730", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Pseudo-classes: very simple and lightweight mockObject-like classes for unit-testing", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028730"}
