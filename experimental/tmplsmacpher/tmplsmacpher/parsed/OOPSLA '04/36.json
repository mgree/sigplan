In cite BDMITiCSE1 we argued that event-driven programming is simple enough for CS 1 when introduced with the aid of a library that we have developed. In this paper we argue that early use of event-driven programming makes many of the standard topics of CS 1 much easier for students to learn by breaking them into smaller, more understandable concepts.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Kim B.
