It turns out to be less interesting as a technique for isolating tests from third-party libraries than is widely thought. This paper describes the process of using Mock Objects with an extended example and reports best and worst practices gained from experience of applying the process. It also introduces jMock, a Java framework that embodies our collective experience.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Steve Freeman", "author_profile_id": "81100277535", "affiliation": "ThoughtWorks UK, High Holborn, London", "person_id": "PP14104023", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Tim Mackinnon", "author_profile_id": "81100064189", "affiliation": "ThoughtWorks UK, High Holborn, London", "person_id": "P328306", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Nat Pryce", "author_profile_id": "81100232234", "affiliation": "ThoughtWorks UK, High Holborn, London", "person_id": "PP43117861", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Joe Walnes", "author_profile_id": "81100469423", "affiliation": "ThoughtWorks UK, High Holborn, London", "person_id": "P698130", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028765", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028765", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Mock roles, objects", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028765"}
