Not only are there different processes in place for text and graphical use case modeling, but also there are a variety of approaches and philosophies in each camp. This paper will discuss the prose vs. graphical approaches to requirements elicitation, observed advantages and disadvantages of each, and suggest best practices for improving and/or creating effective processes for requirements elicitation.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Brian A.
