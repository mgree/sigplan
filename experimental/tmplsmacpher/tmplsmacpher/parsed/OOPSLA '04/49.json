We looked at this technology last year in a panel that raised the roof. Today, more vendors are now producing products that support MDA. And we still hear about the success stories that indicate that this technology is the \"real deal\". But, with the failed promises of CASE in the late 1980's, many people still have questions about how much of an application can be generated from models and constraint languages. Is MDA really capable of generating enterprise applications? What are the technologies are available to implement MDA? Are there really special skills needed to generate platform independent applications? How platform independent are they in practice? Here is your opportunity to ask the experts the questions that are necessary to convince you of the validity of this new technology. This time, we bring in the people who are shipping the technology.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Granville Miller", "author_profile_id": "81100160769", "affiliation": "Microsoft", "person_id": "PP14066386", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Scott Ambler", "author_profile_id": "81100518292", "affiliation": "Ronin International, Inc.", "person_id": "PP14180066", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "author_profile_id": "81100109893", "affiliation": "Microsoft", "person_id": "PP14048609", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Stephen Mellor", "author_profile_id": "81100022477", "affiliation": "Mentor Graphics", "person_id": "P268598", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Karl Frank", "author_profile_id": "81539922156", "affiliation": "Borland", "person_id": "P335580", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jon Kern", "author_profile_id": "81100599049", "affiliation": "Compuware", "person_id": "P698131", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028719", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028719", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Model driven architecture: the realities, a year later", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028719"}
