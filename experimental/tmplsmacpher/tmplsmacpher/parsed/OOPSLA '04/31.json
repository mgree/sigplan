The concept of a named interface is typically introduced at a much later stage, usually in connection with inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes. In this paper we point out that interfaces as a language mechanism can be introduced much earlier, even before inheritance. This way the concept of an explicit class interface can be decoupled from the more complicated issues of inheritance and subtype-polymorphism.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Axel Schmolitzky", "author_profile_id": "81100640953", "affiliation": "University of Hamburg, Germany", "person_id": "P445244", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028699", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028699", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Objects first, interfaces next or interfaces before inheritance", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028699"}
