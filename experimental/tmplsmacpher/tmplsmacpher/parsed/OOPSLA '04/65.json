The change brought by open platform technologies such as the Symbian operating system and Java technologies has opened up a significant business opportunity for anyone to develop application software such as games for mobile terminals. However, developing mobile applications is currently a challenging task due to the specific demands and technical constraints of mobile development. Furthermore, at the moment very little is known about the suitability of the different development processes for mobile application development. Due to these issues, we have developed an agile development approach called Mobile-D. The Mobile-D approach is briefly outlined here and the experiences gained from four case studies are discussed.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Pekka Abrahamsson", "author_profile_id": "81100165167", "affiliation": "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu", "person_id": "PP39030529", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Antti Hanhineva", "author_profile_id": "81392616101", "affiliation": "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu", "person_id": "P698102", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Hanna Hulkko", "author_profile_id": "81392611975", "affiliation": "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu", "person_id": "P698126", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Tuomas Ihme", "author_profile_id": "81100550415", "affiliation": "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu", "person_id": "P285610", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Juho J&#228;&#228;linoja", "author_profile_id": "81392596651", "affiliation": "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu", "person_id": "P698132", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Mikko Korkala", "author_profile_id": "81100538411", "affiliation": "University of Oulu, Oulu", "person_id": "P698153", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Juha Koskela", "author_profile_id": "81100062012", "affiliation": "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu", "person_id": "P690273", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Pekka Kyll&#246;nen", "author_profile_id": "81392598857", "affiliation": "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu", "person_id": "P698159", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Outi Salo", "author_profile_id": "81100218152", "affiliation": "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu", "person_id": "P484687", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1028664.1028736", "year": "2004", "article_id": "1028736", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Mobile-D: an agile approach for mobile application development", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1028736"}
