Noise starts at dawn or just be\u00adfore; the smell \nnever stops. Pippo is long up, and before his mother begins cooking he s halfway to the build site where \nhe sees bricklayers, cart\u00aders, and leadbeaters already gathering, carrying their tools and leather bags \nof rough meals. Coals are being fluffed to blacksmoke fires and then burning hell for the black\u00adsmith \ns forge and another day of repairing tools. Stealthy cooks steal the blacksmith s flames with tapers \nto start their cookstoves to feed the craftsmen throughout the looming midsummer s day. Pippo joins a \nparade of oxcarts bearing bags of sand and lime, and next to him a merchant lugs a wicker rucksack of \nwine on his back. Pippo s urge is to watch the treadmill hoists and cranes lift their first loads of \nthe day to the top of the nave. The great cathedral of Firenze. t The central problem is to get conceptual \nintegrity in the design itself Fred Brooks told us in his sweet southern voice Mon\u00adtr\u00e9al, OOPSLA 2007, \nduring his keynote [1].

As Brooks spoke mostly off the cuff and paced slowly \naway from the podium and back, I fell under his spell as I suppose did most of his audience. He went \non: If we look back then at the 19th century and the things that happened the cartwright and the tex\u00adtile \nmachinery, Stephenson (the train), Brunel s bridges and railway, Edison , Ford, the Wright broth\u00aders, \netc these were very largely the designs of sin\u00adgle designers or, in the case of the Wright brothers, \npairs. [1] Read that paragraph aloud and you ll hear the rhythm of his speaking. I wanted very much to \nbelieve every word he said he s Fred Brooks after all. The Mythical Man Month. OS/360. And why not? \nnothing sounds off, and it s certain he s done his homework. I ll quote him at length now: Now if we \nlook back at the history of human pro\u00adduction and culture, most works of art have not been made [by teams]. \nAnd that s true whether we look at literature, whether we look at music although we have Gilbert and \nSullivan; notice that one did the words and one did the music Brunelleschi s dome, Michelangelo s tremendous \nworks, the paintings there are some paintings by two painters; one did the creatures and one did the \nlandscape kinda thing, this careful division of labor and the exceptions to the notion that most of the \ngreat works we know of were done by one mind are in fact done by two minds and not by teams. [1] Fred \nBrooks imagines an ideal when he thinks of design: conceptual integrity arising from a single mind creating \na design. Brooks once wrote conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design, \n[2] and by conceptual integrity he means one set of design ideas. Every part must reflect the same philosophies \nand the same balancing of desiderata [2]. Conceptual integrity dictates that the design must proceed \nfrom one mind, or from a small number of agreeing resonant minds [2]. modern scholars now recognize that \nthe works of Homer are the works of one mind. [T]he im\u00adportant poem Beowulf is a literary work of one \nmind. As I say the exceptions are two, and two is a magic number. There are many, many jobs in the world \nthat are designed for two people: the carpenter and the carpenter s helper, the electrician and the elec\u00adtrician \ns helper. And I think our Lord knew what He was doing when He made marriage work for two. But now let \ns look at some of these magnificent works. Brunelleschi s dome and many of you have read the book was \na tremendous creation, technically beyond what people believed possible. He had to pro\u00adduce a working \nscale model before the people buying the project would even believe that it could be built. And notice \nthe scale of this building in comparison with the surrounding buildings. [1] Fred Brooks went on to speak \nof why we need to design in teams. He gave three reasons: the first is that engineer\u00ading is now sufficiently \nsophisticated that specialists are re\u00adquired to create the designs. The third is that many hands make \nlight work that is, it helps to break up an enormous task into smaller ones that are more readily achieved. \nHere is how he phrased the second reason: Now, the second major reason why we do things in teams is hurry \nto get to market. We all know the rule that the first person to market with a totally new innovation \ntends to stabilize out with 40 or 45 percent of the share, and the rest is divided up among the come \nlatelys. [1] When Brooks said this it tweaked a memory from the days when I was creating arguments for \nand against a theory I whimsically proposed in 1991, now known as worse is better. That theory argues \nthat the best and most endur\u00ading products and their designs arise from producing an adequate design and \nimplementation, and then making it available and putting it to use so its users have an opportu\u00adnity \nto contribute to its future refinement. In short it s a way to learn the real requirements before it \ns too late. While working out the arguments, I became interested in the arc from conception to usage \nfor all sorts of things software, consumer goods, and even works of art. While exploring this I stumbled \nacross the work of Gerard J. Tel\u00adlis and Peter N. Golder, two business researchers who con\u00adcluded that \nthe dictum first to market is really a myth [3]. A myth created by poor research methodology and impre\u00adcise \ndefinitions. First the shocking truth: looking at 66 categories of busi\u00adnesses, Tellis and Golder found \nthat the mean market share of the pioneer companies is 6% (as of the year 2000). Of the 36 categories \nwhere the pioneer entered their market before 1940, the market share is 6%; for categories first entered \nbe\u00adtween 1940 and 1974, it is 10%; and after 1974 it is 4%. This is a long way off from 40 to 45 percent. \nNow the reasons. Studies before Tellis and Golder made 3 fatal errors. First, even when they tried to \nbe objective, in\u00advestigators usually ignored pioneers who failed completely or left the market. For example, \nmany consider Gillette the pioneer in safety razors, but in fact Gillette is merely the oldest surviving \nplayer in that market. The safety razor had been patented and was sold by several companies de\u00adcades \nbefore Gillette was founded, and an early design for the safety razor had been created a century before \nGillette came on the scene. Second, many studies suffer from self-report bias. Inves\u00adtigators in such \nstudies survey companies currently in the market and rely on those companies telling the researchers \nwho the pioneers are/were. Procter &#38; Gamble, for example, claims to be the disposable diaper pioneer: \nP&#38;G reports it literally created the disposable diaper business in the U.S. [4]. Yet, for decades \nbefore Pampers came along, other com\u00adpanies sold disposable diapers: the pioneer was a company called \nChux, which introduced disposables in 1934. Pampers entered the market in 1961. Third, there are definitional \nproblems with some surveys trying to determine first-to-market advantage. For example, Wang dominated \nthe word processor market for a long time, where a word processor was defined as a dedicated word processing \nmachine. Another is to define as pioneer as a company that entered a market early in its history. This \nis why Gillette is considered a pioneer in the safety razor business. Brooks s statement also seemed \nodd because I knew that he knows about this effect. In the 20th anniversary edition of The Mythical Man-Month, \nhe wrote: One of the most impressive developments in soft\u00adware during the past two decades has been the \ntri\u00adumph of the Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointing in\u00adterface . This concept was first publicly displayed \nby Doug Engelbart and his team from the Stanford Research Institute at the Western Joint Computer Conference \nof 1968. From there the ideas went to Xe\u00adrox Palo Alto Research Center, where they emerged in the Alto \npersonal workstation, developed by Bob Taylor and team. They were picked up by Steve Jobs for the Apple \nLisa, a computer too slow to carry its exciting ease-of-use concepts. These concepts Jobs then embodied \nin the commercially success\u00adful Apple Macintosh in 1985. They were later ad\u00ad opted in Microsoft Windows \nfor the IBM PC and compatibles. [2] Of course, this history ignores Sketchpad [5] and possi\u00ad bly even \nearlier ideas, as well as contemporaries of the Alto like the MIT Lisp Machine. But getting back to Brooks \ns talk: the seed was plant\u00ad ed the seed of doubt. Maybe Fred Brooks could be wrong. Not wrong, really, \nbut incomplete. Incomplete in his scholarship or depth of analysis. Or maybe he as many of us do looks \na little too optimistically for the real world to confirm his ideas. Or he is not wrong but in situ examples \nare too messy to be perfect. As G. B. Shaw could have said, they are too true to be good. t Pippo back \nhome and over breakfast asks his father to tell him again the story of the cathedral. Breakfast: his \nmother s prepared his favorite salt pork fried in orange and lemon with sugar and cinnamon sprinkled \nover. His father tells him again the 40th time? about the immense and immensely beautiful design of Arnolfo \ndi Cambio, and how they razed the old church and even another to make room, how they brought in slaves \nto remove the corpses from the old cemetery, how the workers stopped and the cathedral was abandoned \nafter the sickness came, how the nave and fa\u00e7ade stood out in the rain every winter for more than 10 \nyears. Over the bleats of sheep and goats and clucks and honks of chickens and geese Pippo hears the \nshouts of orders from the work site. But why has it taken so long, Pippo asks. It s almost 100 years \nand it s not half done. His father answers: We must always await the gifts from God that show us the \nway for\u00ad ward. t My experience writing poems, writing stories, doing pho\u00ad tography, working on small \ngraphics and drawing projects is that design and art are rarely the product of a single mind. I take \nthat back; they never are. There are two ways that the single mind idea doesn t work with art and poetry. \nThe easy one to understand is the ways that others are constantly helping. As a writer I encounter help \nin all sorts of ways. I ve never published anything in a serious venue without some friend or colleague \nand usually several having read and commented on it. I take the comments seriously, and there are several \nfriends whose recommendations I adopt essentially without question. The typical nonfiction book is full \nof acknowledgements that indicate a co-author-type relationship, and that s true for my writings. And \neven when an artist seems to be creating something completely new artists like da Vinci, van Gogh, or \nBeck\u00adett it usually turns out there are hidden, unconscious in\u00adfluences even they can t recognize. One \nof the more well-known examples of this sort of help is the relationship between T. S. Eliot and Ezra \nPound. Roughly around 1920, Eliot started work on his best-known poem and masterpiece, called The Waste \nLand. At that time both Pound and Eliot were expatriates Eliot in England, Pound in France who on occasion \nworked together, with Pound generally playing the role of mentor. Pound was a sort of talent scout, and \nhad helped Eliot get his first poems published a few years earlier. On his way to Switzerland for a rest \ncure, Eliot took his Waste Land manuscript of about 1000 lines to Pound in Paris for comments, and he \nstopped in Paris again on his trip back. There were undoubtedly many conversations, but also there are \nmarked up manuscripts in the Berg Collection in the New York Public Library that tell us the story of \nthe collaboration. Pound found the heart of Eliot s manuscript and directed him in paring it down to \nthe 434 lines we see today. Don t be fooled: Pound did not merely scrape away words, lines, and stanzas \n(though that s what he mostly did); Pound s com\u00adments are extensive if cryptic to readers not accustomed \nto artists talking to each other and not particularly subtle. He pointed out weaknesses and suggested \nchanges. Eliot wrote this about the role Pound played in The Waste Land: It was in 1922 that I placed \nbefore him in Paris the manuscript of a sprawling, chaotic poem called The Waste Land which left his \nhands, reduced to about half its size, in the form in which it appears in print. I should like to think \nthat the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared ir\u00adrecoverably: yet on the other hand, \nI should wish the blue penciling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound s critical genius. \nT. S. Eliot, Erza Pound [6] A hypothetical programming language example with lots of deletions and some \nrevision to think about: suppose, in a world with nothing like Lisps, someone designing a programming \nlanguage came up with essentially a messy version of what we would call Common Lisp. The Pound for this \nEliot might well identify a subset of the language which, when cleaned up and revised a bit, would turn \nout to be what we would call Scheme. Common Lisp is very large, even rambling, and Scheme is small and \nelegant; the major fundamental difference between them is that Com\u00admon Lisp has separate namespaces for \nfunctions and values while Scheme has a single namespace. A particular subset of Common Lisp is not far \noff at all from Scheme the revi\u00adsions to make it Scheme would encompass only some small syntactic changes, \nthe namespace collapsing, and the ad\u00addition of continuations. Suppose our software Eliot made those revisions \non the advice of our software Pound: would this Eliot be the genius who came up with the masterpiece \nknown in our world as Scheme? Be the sole author of its conceptual integrity? Collaboration of authorship \nis not always or mostly about pruning. Richard Woodhouse played a similar but less ex\u00adtensive role for \nhis friend, John Keats. In several important poems, the revised wording of lines come either after sug\u00adgestions \nby Woodhouse or using the words Woodhouse proposed [7]. Copyeditors can make substantial contributions \nto a manuscript. Changes beyond grammar are not uncommon. Such changes were made to some of the most \nimportant Keats poems by his publisher, John Taylor, including in re\u00adsponse to directions from Keats \nto Taylor, which Woodhouse reported as follows: accept which [readings] they pleased, &#38; re\u00advise \nthe Whole. [6] Other poets practice what could be called creative pla\u00adgiarism. Samuel Taylor Coleridge \nseems sometimes to have taken another poet s poem as a very detailed starting point for his own. It is \nwell researched that some of the material in his most famous prose piece, Biographia Literaria, was a \ncomposite of several passages taken from Leibniz [7]. Technical books almost always go out to reviewers \nwho occasionally propose major changes. In the past I ve pro\u00adposed to book authors radical organizational \nand even the\u00admatic revisions that were adopted. I ve also reviewed drafts of novels and poetry manuscripts \nwhere my substantial changes have been adopted, sometimes word for word. Many writers even in technical \nfields use writers work\u00adshops to improve their manuscripts. Some published pieces have been workshopped \nmany times. In a writers workshop, a more-or-less formal process is used to go deeply into a manuscript \nin such a way that the writer is inclined to lis\u00adten carefully to the suggestions, and the final sometimes \ncrucial step of the process produces concrete suggestions for improvement. It s not uncommon for a member \nof a workshop to offer detailed wording, structural, and even fundamental what-is-this-piece-about suggestions. \nt Pippo drinks his milk and wonders how anyone but God could design such a large and most beautiful cathedral. \nArnolfo was a great man, a great mason, his father says. He and the other masons knew how to build great \nbuildings. Arnolfo created a model that all who came after followed and this model was the design of \nthe cathedral. It s said that model had a great dome so that the cathedral would be more grand than any \nother ever built, in order to honor God and Firenze. But the model crumbled away during the sick\u00adness. \nBefore you were born, the capomaestro started a new model for the dome, but the guild of wool merchants \nwas not certain and asked Neri di Fioravanti to build a second, and they would choose. This was wise \nbecause Giovanni di Lapo Ghini, the capomaestro, built an abomination to God and Firenze a great beast \nsuch as are the churches to the north. Ugly buttresses held up the dome; they are makeshifts and the \ntools of the weak mind. Neri s dome a great octagon with a perfect quinto acuto arch was said to be like \nArnolfo s model, but who am I to say? Neri s de\u00adsign was chosen and its model is the one all capomaestri \nsince then have sworn and all who come after must swear to follow. All the citizens of Firenze voted, \neven I. Perhaps you ll live to see it built; perhaps by some miracle revealed in Firenze by God, a great \nman will come to know how to build the dome, and you will see the cathedral consecrated, my son, Filippo \nBrunelleschi. t When I sit down to write a poem, which I do every day, it s true I work alone, but I \ndon t work in isolation. The mate\u00adrials I use for my work come from centuries of other writ\u00aders and artists. \nThe wall of poetry in my library contains about a thousand books, most of which I ve read and all of \nwhich I ve dipped into extensively. Frequently when I write, I have several of these books open in front \nof me, or other work open in a web browser or some other contrap\u00adtion. I use other poems as triggers, \nI take other poems and write them myself, I argue with other writers and poets, I run their poems through \n(bad) automated translators and other software to get starting points, I google to seek out strange results \npages and write starting from them (a new poetic form called flarf). These are forms of internet age \nbricolage, collage, pastiche, and oulipo (OUvroir de LItt\u00e9ra\u00adture POtentielle or workshop of potential \nliterature), where literature is created from what happens to be around using cut-and-paste, hodge-podge, \nand various (usually artificial) constraints or automatic transformations. More than that, I write within \na tradition of poetry and as part of a western, 21st century culture. I rarely invent words and I almost \nas rarely make up grammar. I rely on the words in my pieces to conjure specific references in readers \nminds, I expect them to look up the words they don t know in dictionaries. I expect them to know or be \nable to figure out, if they like, the cultural or media references I use. I ex\u00adpect them to know when \nI m writing a sonnet and to have read lots of them. I am alone, not isolated. Triggers play today the \nrole that God and the muses did in the past. Artists and what we would today call engi\u00adneers await a \nrevelation or spark from a mysterious source, and that spark would start and shape the process of cre\u00adation. \nRichard Hugo, 20th century poet and teacher of po\u00adetry, wrote: A poem can be said to have two subjects, \nthe ini\u00adtiating or triggering subject, which starts the poem or causes the poem to be written, and the \nreal or generated subject, which the poem comes to say or mean, and which is generated or discovered \nin the poem during the writing. That s not quite right be\u00adcause it suggests that the poet recognizes \nthe real subject. The poet may not be aware of what the real subject is but [has] only some instinctive \nfeeling that the poem is done. Richard Hugo, The Triggering Town [8] For many poets, poetry is a conversation \nwith other po\u00adets a dialog of themes, words, images, structures, stories, and sometimes (but rarely) \nmeanings. One quick example. Orpheus in Greek mythology has many functions and roles, but the top ones \nare being poet and musician, inven\u00adtor or master of the lyre, and teaching humanity medicine, writing, \nand agriculture. His wife, Eurydice, was snakebit and died, and went to the underworld and no one comes \nback from the underworld. Orpheus wrote and sang such sad songs the gods wept and suggested he go there \nto make his case. His songs melted the hearts of Hades and Perse\u00adphone who agreed to let Eurydice return \nwith him to the upper world on one condition: that Orpheus walk in front of Eurydice and not look back \nnot once until both of them made it back to the upper world. He agreed. They traveled in silence up through \nthe passages, and when they were nearly out he had to know that she was there behind him, and so he glanced \nback and right at that moment she was snatched away dying a second time. Eurydice didn t blame him and \ncalled her farewell, but the sound only almost reached him. The story goes on but this is enough. I don \nt know how many Eurydice poems there are. Here are parts of two of them. Eurydice by the poet H. D. is \nwritten from the point of view of Eurydice, who is none too pleased at Orpheus. Part II begins like this: \nHere only flame upon flame and black among the red sparks, streaks of black and light grown colorless \n why did you turn back, that hell should be reinhabited of myself thus swept into nothingness? why did \nyou turn back? why did you glance back? why did you hesitate for that moment? why did you bend your face \ncaught with the flame of the upper earth, above my face?  In this poem, Eurydice moves from despising \nthe un\u00adderworld and longing for the upper, to anger at Orpheus for blowing the rescue, to almost an arrogance \nat how her situation in the underworld is better than his in the upper because in the end she locates \nwithin herself all the earthly beauty she at first misses; moreover, the underworld must open like a \nred rose to let her back in. Jorie Graham seems to like writing Eurydice poems. One is in her 1987 collection \ncalled The End of Beauty and an\u00adother in Swarm from 1999. Graham is never easy to figure out (for me), \nbut my reading of Orpheus and Eurydice from 1987 is this: it s a poem from Eurydice s point of view right \nat the point where Orpheus is about to turn back to her. She is thinking about Orpheus s about-to-happen \nglance, and how it will erase her, as his glance has always erased her. As he turns to glance she at \nfirst (or he at first) wants to stop the glance, and then she (he) wants to take it in. She sees the \nreal world up ahead, but she and the real world cannot be merged by Orpheus. Here is a bit from the heart \nof the poem, about where it turns: (Now the cypress are swaying) (Now the lake in the distance) (Now \nthe view-from-above, the aerial attack of do you remember?) now the glance reaching her shoreline wanting \nonly to be recalled, now the glance reaching her shoreline wanting only to be taken in, (somewhere the \ncastle above the river) (somewhere you holding this piece of paper)  Visits to the underworld like Orpheus \ns appear in the Japanese myth of Izanagi and Izanami, the Akkadian/Sum\u00aderian myth of Inanna s descent \nto the underworld, and the Mayan myth of Ix Chel and Itzamna. The m(yth)eme of not looking back is also \nfound in the story of Lot s wife when escaping Sodom and in Hansel and Gretel. Something else, though, \nis going on here beyond the con\u00adversation between poets. In both Eurydice poems written at different \ntimes by very different poets we are witnessing a known structure with different decorations, with differ\u00adent \npoints of view, with different lessons, with different aesthetics, but with an underlying shall we call \nit con\u00adceptual integrity. Not from a single mind, really, and not from a small number of agreeing resonant \nminds. What is common is that the thing being created each poem participated in its own creation. This \nis the other way that the single mind idea doesn t work with art and poetry the harder one to understand. \nIn these cases, the Eurydice story forms a frame that di\u00adrects where and how the poet can extend and \nuse it. Built\u00adin understandings and explanations, and already defined moods and images come to mind when \nthe story is retold, and these form surfaces against which the meanings, im\u00adages, moods, thoughts, and \nemotions of the new material bounce and reflect. The underlying story imposes a strong sense of what \nwould be in keeping with it. And approach\u00ading the Eurydice story from any direction, the story itself \ndoes its own refracting. t Filippo is secretive; he works in isolation perhaps because of his looks: \nshort, long nose, recessed chin, thin lips and his dress doesn t help: he is typically messy and dirty. \nAfter losing the competition for the Baptistry doors to Lorenzo Ghiberti, he and his young friend Donatello \ntravel to Rome to study Roman art and architecture. Filippo would stay on and off for 13 years. Rome \nis a mess. Those left live across the river from St Peter s. The rest of Rome is an urbanized wilderness. \nGreat Roman buildings serve as markets, pens, storehouses. Fil\u00adippo s not here for the Christian sites, \nnot the relics like fingers and legbones, not the cribs or heads. Neither is he here for the hucksters, \nthe beggars. He is here for Rome, for the greatness that was once Rome. Romans could build things that \ncannot now be built, buildings whose sense and beauty and proportion cannot now be matched. Their art \nwas not over-elaborated; it was clean and precise. It was austere but not flat. And how did they build? \nLike Neri s model their domes didn t need supports like sticks holding up a bad roof. Fil\u00adippo spends \nmonths observing, measuring, taking notes in his secret way in his code. He and Donatello dig for remnants \nfor pots, for utensils, for coins and medals. He returns every few days to the domes specially to the \nPan\u00adtheon. Neri s dome would be about this size, he reckons. Taller but about this big around. How did \nthe Romans do it? Those cracks when did they appear? The coffers are they for decoration or to make the \ndome lighter? They sleep under any overhang. They eat what comes along. t A designer struggles to create \na first draft of a design, then, not to be merely an important step in the design process, but in order \nto create a collaborator that will make the remain\u00adder of the design process easier not a literal collaborator \nwith a brain, sharp wit, and funny hair, but a concrete thing (almost some sort of being) that helps \ndirect the thoughts and actions of the designer. A collaborator that triggers thoughts and directions \nthat would never occur to the de\u00adsigner were the artifact not sitting there, staring back. To many outside \nthe arts this statement is a profound surprise and enduring mystery. Eliot wrote: In a poem which is \nneither didactic nor narra\u00adtive, and not animated by any other social purpose, the poet may be concerned \nsolely with expressing in verse using all his resources of words, with their history, their connotations, \ntheir music this ob\u00adscure impulse. He does not know what he has to say until he has said it; and in the \neffort to say it he is not concerned in making other people understand any\u00adthing. He is not concerned, \nat this stage, with other people at all: only with finding the right words or, anyhow, the least wrong \nwords. He is not concerned whether anybody else will ever listen to them or not, or whether anybody else \nwill ever understand them if he does. He is oppressed by a burden which he must bring to birth in order \nto obtain relief. T. S. Eliot, On Poetry and Poets [9] There is something inside that needs its birth. \nThere are right words or least wrong ones to express what it is. The poet is not constructing something \nin Eliot s description, but finding the words to go with this obscure thing. It is as if the thing itself \nis directing the blind poet; as if the thing itself is designing itself or at least designing its expression. \nIn my book on the writers workshop I recalled what I heard many times in workshops and in the classroom. \nIt went like this: In the creative writing workshop, you often hear comments like these: What is this \npiece trying to be? and What is the center of this work? These comments aim at an attitude in which the \npiece exists on its own in the world and the reviewers are trying to get at its essence and make the \nbest of whatever it is. Richard P. Gabriel, Writers Workshops [10] Stephen King says the same sort of \nthing when he argues that there is not much planning in the kind of writing he does (which can t easily \nbe mistaken for poetry): You may wonder where plot is in all this. The answer is nowhere . I believe \nplotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren t compatible . I want you to understand that my basic \nbelief about the making of stories is that they pretty much make themselves. The job of the writer is \nto give them a place to grow. Stephen King, On Writing [11] This reminds me a little of the ideas of \nChristopher Alex\u00adander, maybe after a bit of a stretch. Alexander believes and this is pretty clear from \nhis recent book (in 4 volumes collectively called The Nature of Order [12]) that life which is both \na literal term as well as a term that refers to that quality of built objects that are whole, lively, \nwonderful, comfortable, bittersweet, and generally where people want to live their lives emerges from \nthe geometric characteris\u00adtics of the features that make up (things in) space. He defines a concept he \ncalls centers and 15 characteristics of them alone and in combination and he argues that if something \nhas a sufficiently strong set of centers as measured by the number and richness of their characteristics, \nthen it is whole or alive. In earlier work on patterns and pattern languages, he called this quality \nthe quality without a name. An essential part of Alexander s thoughts on centers is that their existence \nis objective not the result of an in\u00adthe-eye-of-the-beholder theory. His view is (almost) that someday \na computer program with sensors could be used to find them and the ones thus mechanically found would \nbe precisely the ones just about every person from just about every culture would find. Spiritual to \nthe end, Alexander sees centers as the I, an underlying Godstuff: It is ultimate, beyond experience the \ncore of all living structures the driving force behind what must be done. It lies in me and beyond me, \nis without form and name, lies behind matter, is connected to all living structure and therefore is impersonal. \na kind of light. the spirit which animates, but a ma\u00adterial or physical spirit. the face of God. Christopher \nAlexander, The Nature of Order [12] A few years ago I used Alexander s ideas to construct a hypothesis \nto explain what poetry is namely, how poetic writing differs from ordinary writing and a method for re\u00advising \npoems by identifying weaknesses in them. In essence, the method works by finding places to revise and \nsuggest\u00ading avenues for revision. After listening to Brooks s talk, I started examining how Alexander \ns theories can be used to explain the process by which an artifact participates in its own design and \nhow conceptual integrity springs from the strengths of the thing designed. I began this examination with \nmy theory of poetry. To start to see what we think of this idea, let s take a quick look at the concept \nof centers and the 15 characteristics, and see how they apply to the process of writing poetry. I ve \nput all the material on centers in a box up and to the right; you can skim it or skip it and use just \nthe gestalt of my poetry example to get the idea. For Alexander, the process of design and building is \nan iterative process. The first two steps, in their original sim\u00adplified form, are as follows: 1. At \nevery step of the process whether conceiving, de\u00adsigning, making, maintaining, or repairing we must always \nbe concerned with the whole within which we are making anything. We look at this wholeness, absorb it, \ntry to feel its deep structure. 2. We ask which kind of thing we can do next that will do the most to \ngive this wholeness the most positive increase of life.  Center: A center is any place in a poem that \nattracts attention; cen\u00adters can arise from the action/interaction of these craft elements: stress/unstress; \nsound; unit of syntax; rhyme; repeated words and sounds; line; first word in a line; last word in a line; \nstanza; image; metaphor and other figures; title; the poem itself; historical or po\u00adlitical elements; \nrevealed metaphysics; meaning Levels of Scale: centers at all levels of scale Strong Center: a center \nrelated to many other centers Boundaries: separates a center from other centers, focuses atten\u00ad tion \non the separated center, is itself made of centers Alternating Repetition: strong centers repeated with \nalternating centers; not simple repeating; pattern with variation Positive Space: a center that moves \noutward from itself, seemingly oozing life rather than collapsing on itself Good Shape: a center that \nis beautiful by itself Local Symmetries: a center with another nearby which is some\u00ad how an echo Deep \nInterlock and Ambiguity: centers that are hard to pull apart; centers that derive power from surrounding \ncenters; centers that cannot be removed without diminishment; centers that are part of several others \nContrast: differentiation, distinctness, discernible opposites Gradients: softness; qualities vary subtly, \ngradually, slowly Roughness: a certain ease; the inessential is left messy Echoes: family resemblance \nnot exact replication The Void: stillness or literally a quiet point Simplicity and Inner Calm: all irrelevant \nparts are gone; it is as simple and spare as it can be and still retain its life; nothing more can be \nremoved; each part seems simple and simply made Not-Separateness: at one with the world, and not separate \nfrom it The remaining steps ask us to make the change and assess its effectiveness continuing or undoing, \ndepending. The kinds of things that can be done to increase life are to add centers (where there are \nonly latent centers), strengthen cen\u00adters, or apply (structure-preserving) transformations that introduce \nor strengthen the characteristics listed above. t Back from Rome, Filippo is engrossed in the cathedral. \nA competition for how to build Neri s dome had been an\u00adnounced, and he is preparing his model with his \nfriend Do\u00adnatello and the sculptor Nanni di Banco, son of the late ca\u00adpomaestro. He s worked out a way \nto build the dome without internal scaffolding or other support. Filippo s short temper and mistrust \nwon t let him reveal all his ideas just enough to win. He smiles, though, when his beautifully sculpted, \ngilded, and painted model spanning 6 feet and 12 feet tall tips the contest in his direction, mostly, \nand his plan is chosen he is named capomaestro. Along with his chief rival in the contest, Lorenzo Ghiberti \nand two others. The wardens of the Opera del Duomo will let his plan go forward for O of the height, \nand then the plan must be revisited. The cathedral has its new name, now, and all Firenze is in a tizzy \nover it: Santa Maria del Fiore. And Filippo walks proudly through the city because he has been chosen \nto bring the people of Firenze Neri di Fio\u00adravanti s dome, the one they have always wanted. Neri s perfect \ndesign to cap Arnolfo di Cambio s perfect design for the cathedral. For Our Lady of the Flower. t Extreme \nPoetry To see exactly how an artifact might be a col\u00adlaborator, I ve pulled out an example from my MFA \nstudies. Bill Knott is an important but ultimately minor poet. He writes funny poems that in many cases \nhave their own brand of ratio\u00adnality. Knott s poems are short, which suits my purpose, and absolutely \nmost importantly his published work contains a poem and its revi\u00adsion. The poem is called Lourdes, and \nit first appeared in his 1976 collection, Rome in Rome [13]. The revision appeared in another collec\u00adtion, \nBecos [14], in 1983. To the right is the first of these, marked up with an analysis of its centers and \ntheir relationships. (The second copy right below it highlights the poem s weak centers.) Be\u00adfore you \ntry to read it, some advice. First, poems are not necessarily for making total sense of and Knott s poetry \nis often very nonsensical. Sec\u00adond, for the purposes of our exploration, it s not required that you understand \nthe poem or even the deep meaning of centers and the character\u00adistics as they relate to poetry all that \ns needed is to see how the inherent strengths and weak\u00adnesses of this poem directed its revision (maybe). \n[see Note A] Take a quick look at the poem and its analysis. The black (dark) marks indicate strong centers \nand red (lighter) indicate weak centers. A center is anything a reader notices, along with its con\u00adnections \nto other, related centers. For example, imagine a simple 4-line poem that rhymes in the pattern a-b-a-b. \nA reader will notice the last word in each line, and also that the end words of lines 1 and 3 rhyme. \nThe end word in line 1 is therefore a center, and its strength derives both from its appearing at the \nend of a line and also from the word that Echoes its sound at the end of line 3. And because the rhymes \nof the poem intertwine, the poem demonstrates Alternating Repetition along with Deep Interlock and Ambiguity, \nmak\u00ading the poem itself a strong center. To spare you the details, I ve put the complete explanation \nof the center-based analysis on my website [15]. I ll comment briefly on the centers in the first stanza, \nthen move on to the weak  centers, which should direct Knott s revision, if my theory is right. Each \nstanza is a center. The first stanza has connections to two others via the repeated word, miracles ; \nthese repetitions form Echoes or a sort of Alternating Repetition. The first stanza is about hope while \nthe last is about hopelessness, so these centers (stanzas) are related by Contrast. Stan\u00adzas 2 4 are \nsomewhere between hope and hope\u00adlessness, so all the stanzas taken together form a Gradient. Miracles \nin the first stanza Contrasts with common in the second. There are Echoes in the phrases Observers of, \n chance of, before of, and far off, which link the first stanza to the next two. We notice these Echoes, \npartly because some of them are so unusual, and once we ve no\u00adticed the unusual ones, similar-sounding \nphras\u00ades are lumped into the group. The Boundary be\u00adtween the first and second stanzas is clear cut because \nthe lines are repeated; the repeated lines also form a Deep Interlock (because they lock the two stanzas \ntogether) and Ambiguity (because it isn t clear whether the line (really) belongs in the first or second \nstanza Knott solves that by put\u00adting it in both). That s how a centers-based analysis goes. Now let s \nfocus on the weak centers in the poem. I ve put just them in a diagram at the bottom of the previous \npage. Most of the weaknesses are about not making sense or using weak words at the ends of lines. The \nmajor weakness is the last stanza, which just doesn t have as many arrows and black comments. Let s look \nat the revision (up to the right). (Parts not re\u00advised are in grey.) All but two of the weak centers \nhave been repaired (and one of them was strengthened). Better end words in general strengthen existing \ncenters, and even when sentences and phrases remain the same, different lineation (line breaks) strengthens \nthe centers. Subtle rhythm changes improve the centers for example changing hear to hear tell adds a \nspondee (two stresses or beats in a row), which is a strong center, and also gives the first stanza this \n(nice) beat pattern: 4, 5, 4, 5 (number of stresses per line). The real news is the last stanza, which \nis newly packed with centers the intertwining and reinforcing of them within the stanza would take too \nlong to describe com\u00adpletely here. Notice how misled, skewed, and point ev\u00aderywhere bounce off each other \nand also off of crisscross, which bounces off of crossroads, which links to roadsigns, which links to \nsignpost, which links to postcards. etc. The noise is much better, it s clearer, and this stanza is now \nthe Strong(est) Center in the poem. Even small things like changing muddy to weedy improve the sound \nand also make the image cleaner: a muddy crossroads is actually busy, while a weedy one is abandoned. \nAnd its image of a quiet, confused, and confusing nowhere with a Jesus-miracle-like quality gives it \na hint of The Void. Most of the the weak centers of the first version of Lourdes have been addressed. \nIf a centers-based analysis is objec\u00adtive as Alexander believes then it would seem the poem has helped \nwith its own revision and hence creation. t Consecration day March 25, 1436, the Feast of the Annun\u00adciation \nthough the cathedral is not finished, not even the dome which is near its full height, Pope Eugenius \nIV has just consecrated Santa Maria del Fiore. Still left are the top of the dome closing it s skyward-gazing \neye with an 8-sided cap shaped a bit like a chapel to let light in and the red tile facing on the dome \nitself. During the ceremony, the Pope laid all the cathedral s relics on the altar. One by one, the Cardinal \nchristened the red crosses held in the hands of the wooden statues of the twelve apostles spread in a \nhalf circle around the altar one by one, their spirits entered the cathedral, filling it with God s love. \nNot finished as a building, at that moment Santa Maria was complete as a cathedral. Every bell in the \ncity is ringing out. The day is cruel cold. Filippo, his ears filled with cries of genius and dome maker, \nwalks across the bridge and up the hill to the meadow where he looks back tears in his eyes from joy, \npride, and cold wind back at the dome, at the cathedral. Clouds enclose the sky but cloudbreaks light \nup the city, catch the smoke rising up and quickly away. He fights an urge felt as an impulse from the \nfuture to raise his arms up and shout I m the king of the world. Instead he begins composing in his brilliant \nand fertile mind a sonnet of insult to those who doubted him. t Poetry: why oh why poetry to explore \ndesign? Can t you give us software source code? Indeed I could. Easily. Po\u00adetry, though, is the Queen \nof Arts according to the poet Thomas Sprat [16], and one of the arts most obviously sub\u00adject to creativity \nand individual talent and expression. I ar\u00adgue: if even a poem helps direct its own creation, why not \nthe artifacts in a mundane discipline like software design? You want code examples? Read Martin Fowler \ns book on refactoring [17]. Here is how he begins his description of that book on his website: Refactoring \nis a controlled technique for improv\u00ading the design of an existing code base. Its essence is applying \na series of small behavior-preserving transformations, each too small to be worth do\u00ading . However the \ncumulative effect of each of these transformations is quite significant. By doing them in small steps \nyou reduce the risk of introducing er\u00adrors. You also avoid having the system broken while you are carrying \nout the restructuring which al\u00adlows you to gradually refactor a system over an ex\u00adtended period of time. \nMartin Fowler [18] The original design however it came to be guides the refactoring, just as the weak \ncenters guide at least where and sometimes how to strengthen them. The design col\u00adlaborates in its further \nrefinement. The centers-based analysis of poetry shows one way the designed can act as designer in this \ncase by using a method devised to elicit direction from the poem. Alexander believes that centers and \ntheir structure are how any geometrical design converses with its human designers [12]. In Space: The \nFinal Frontier, Jim Coplien applies the idea of centers to software and the creation of design patterns \n[19]. t Though Brunelleschi had enemies in Florence, he also had great admirers who managed to make him \nonly one of two people buried in the cathedral and the other is a Floren\u00adtine saint. Brunelleschi is \nburied under a marble slab that reads: Corpus Magni Ingenii Viri Philippi Brunelleschi Fiorentini which \ntranslates roughly to here lies the body of the great mechanical genius Filippo Brunelleschi of Florence. \nHis epitaph, written by Carlo Marsuppini, reads: The architect D. S. Quantum Philippus will be considered \nworthy in the arts of Daedalus because both the marvelous dome of this most renowned temple as well as \nmany other things were possible through this example of machines invented by di\u00advinely inspired genius; \nwherefore, because of the ex\u00adceptional gifts and singular virtues of this soul, on xv. Kal. May 1446 \na grateful country commanded that his [well-deserving] body [of blessed memory] be buried hereunder in \nthis soil.. translation by Guy L. Steele Jr. After Brunelleschi s death and before his burial, there \nwas a plan to decorate his tomb site with pictures in marble of his mechanisms and perhaps this explains \nthe wording of the epitaph, where it says this example. So why this em\u00adphasis on his mechanical ingenuity? \nToday Brunelleschi is known as a great architect and his masterpiece is the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore. \nMost of what Brunelleschi did during the 16 years it took to build the dome (minus its facing) was to \nconcoct devices for this or that: some large and impressive cranes and hoists, a barge to bring the gigantic \nlogs and blocks of marble up the Arno (though it sank on the way to Florence), and a variety of mechanisms \nto make building the dome possible. These are not what we think of as architectural design but rather \nclever engineering. His model of the dome with which he won the competition to build it was either just \nlike or mostly like Neri s before him. The ingenuity he brought to bear thought up a num\u00adber of mechanisms \nthat enabled the dome to be built without centering (scaffolding that supports the bricks while the mortar \nsets and the dome is completed). In any dome the two main problems stem from the downward pull of gravity; \nthe first is that the top of the dome would prefer to be pulled down to the ground, and the second is \nthat the force of gravity down on the cen\u00adter of the dome causes hoop forces that would like to spread \n the base of the dome outward, and in this case off of its supports. Brunelleschi used 4 mecha\u00adnisms \nto counter these problems. First is a double dome one in\u00adside the other which forms a box. Some believe \nthe box-like structure accounts entirely for the dome be\u00ad cross-section, viewed from the side ing able \nto stand. Sec\u00adond is a series of stone and metal chains to keep the hoop forces near the bottom of the \ndome in check; though these were part of Neri s design, Neri did not design the chains in detail. The \nthird is a set of circles embedded between the two domes each circle forms a circular arch (parallel \nto the ground) which supports the inward forces where the inward slope of the dome is too great: just \nas an arch holds up a wall so a pas\u00adsageway can be made through it, a circle of bricks or other material \ncan keep an inward-leaning dome from collaps\u00ading while it is being constructed. And finally there is \na her\u00adringbone pattern for the bricks, which forms a number of smaller self-supporting sections of the \ndome as it s being built. One researcher Massimo Ricci [20] has proposed a slightly different theory \nof the mechanisms; the picture of the herringbone pattern above is of the model Ricci built in Florence \nto test that theory. Ah, Brunelleschi did design the lantern, though he died just as its construction \nwas beginning. The lantern is the structure on top of the oculus (the hole at the top of the dome), that \nserves as a source of light for the cathedral, a place to hang out for the rich and famous (and now for \npeo\u00adple like us), and something real pretty. This was his primary or only architectural contribution \nto the cathedral and it was of a pure Gothic style, not a Roman-inspired style as was the hallmark of \nRenaissance architecture in Italy. Most of the cathedral was designed and built before Brunelleschi was \neven born. He had the model of the dome that Neri di Fioravanti produced and which was accepted as definitive \n(when Brunelleschi was a child) by the wardens of the Opera del Duomo. And Brunelleschi had as collabo\u00adrators \nthe buildings in Rome and perhaps techniques from the Middle East that he studied with Donatello. (I \nshould mention that ancient Rome was more technologically ad\u00advanced than Florence in the Renaissance \nthe Romans had aqueducts, could build large arches and domes, and had es\u00adsentially real cement and concrete.) \nMost importantly, like all the other capomaestros, ma\u00adsons, and craftsmen before him (for 140 years), \nhe had the cathedral itself in front of him acting as a designer s helper. The wardens, when they accepted \nhis model of the dome, im\u00adposed milestones when the design and construction meth\u00adods would be revisited. \nThey remarked that at those mile\u00adstones, the dome itself and what had been learned thus far would instruct \nthem how to proceed. The idea that the artifact can direct its design and con\u00adstruction is well established \nin biology, where it s called stigmergy, which its discoverer, Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, defined as stimulation \nof workers by the performance they have achieved. Workers refers to individuals in social insect societies \n[21]. Stigmergy is perhaps more prevalent than biologists believe. Suppose you buy all this suppose you \nbuy that there is typically no such thing as a single mind behind conceptual integrity, and only rarely \nare as few minds as two behind it. Suppose you believe that the thing being built is a collabo\u00adrator \nin its own design and construction. Suppose you see that the ancient Greeks and the story of Eurydice \nhelped H. D. and Graham write their poems, that the inherent structure of Lourdes helped Knott revise \nit. Suppose you are happy that Eliot needed Pound to help him write The Waste Land. Finally, that you \nadmit that Brunelleschi only contributed to the conceptual integrity of Santa Ma\u00adria del Fiore. Then \nwhy would it be so easy for someone as smart as Fred Brooks to believe that conceptual integrity springs \nfrom and requires a single mind? Or that the first to market with something new and innovative will almost \nsurely come away with the bulk of the market? And why is it so easy to believe this when the evidence \nthat those things are not true is so trivial to find? Most of the information I provided about Brunelleschi \ncame from Ross King s book, Brunelleschi s Dome: How a Renaissance Genius Reinvent\u00aded Architecture [22]. \nThis book informed Fred Brooks, and it s pretty clear Ross King, like Brooks, attributes more of the \nbeauty of the dome to Brunelleschi than is deserved brilliant as Brunelleschi s devices and techniques \nmight be, he didn t design the dome in the sense of providing its conceptual integrity: he merely (merely!) \nfigured out how to build it and directed its building, thereby preserving in its execution the conceptual \nintegrity of what appears to have been Neri di Fioravanti s design. It s as if King didn t even read \nhis own book. (And fractal-style we could no doubt continue the historical investigation and find all \nthe ways that the con\u00adceptual integrity of Neri di Fioravanti s dome arose from multiple authors, including \nRoman models, as well as from the dome itself mediated by the laws of physics and existing construction \nmaterials.) Brooks was fooled. We ve all been this same way. Many believe Ronald Reagan single-handedly \ndefeated commu\u00adnism, Tim Berners-Lee single-handedly invented (every\u00adthing about) the World Wide Web, \nLouis V. Gerstner, Jr. single-handedly rescued IBM in the early 1990s, Michael Jordan single-handedly \nwon 6 NBA championships, Gillette invented the safety razor . The list of people (and compa\u00adnies) given \nmore credit than is due could go on, perhaps as long as you like. There s something about our culture \nthat seems to love heroes, that looks for the genius who s solved it all, that seems to need to believe \nthe first to market the best in\u00adventor reaps justly deserved rewards. Two factors combine to manufacture \nthis love of heroes: a failure to perceive the effects of randomness on real life and a need for stories. \nA name and story are less abstract than an intertwined trail of ideas and designs that leads to a monument. \nRandomness affects our perceptions two ways: When someone achieves something that seems rare, perhaps \nunde\u00adservedly rare, we seem unable to see the accidents of chance associated with it; and, second, we \ntend to ascribe to talent or skill alone a measure commensurate with reward, disre\u00adgarding the role of \nrandomness in the outcome. In 1961 Roger Maris exceeded Babe Ruth s home run re\u00adcord of 60 in one season, \nhitting 61 that year. Maris was in a tight race with Mickey Mantle at the time, Mantle being the sentimental \nfavorite. Maris was a good home-run hitter, but after his record season, he never hit more than 33 home \nruns. Many were puzzled (and greatly disappointed) that merely a good home-run hitter broke the dominating \nBabe Ruth s record. People examined Maris s stats and life to see why he deserved the record they tried \nto construct a story to make his achievement coherent. How human. Deserve probably has nothing to do \nwith it. In 1960, Maris hit 39 home runs in 499 at bats. That means he hit a home run every 12.8 at bats \nor once every 3.7 games. Natu\u00adrally, because of randomness, there can be streaks of more and less frequent \nhome runs. Using a simulation to look at the probabilities, I figured a batter with Maris s 1960 skills \nwould hit more than 60 home runs about one year out of 28. I read that a batter with Maris s 1960 stats \ncomes along every 3 years. The question then is how likely is it that some batter between 1927 (Ruth \ns record year) and 1961 would break Ruth s record. I ran a simulation of that: a million 34\u00adyear stretches \nwith a batter like Roger Maris appearing on average once every 3 years. The distribution of home runs \nfor the simulated Maris showed a nice, but narrow, normal distribution normal as in the bell-shaped curve \nso the question is not whether it was possible some batter could break the record, but what the likelihood \nis. The revealed probability that someone would break Ruth s record turned out to be a little over N. \nWhen I looked at the 81-year period from 1927 to 2008, the probability rose to 62%. Simulating Roger \nMaris for about a million years of baseball, I found that in his best years he might hit a little over \n80 home runs, making Barry Bonds s 73 (the current record) seem puny. Roger Maris was unglamorous and \ntightlipped about his game, so we don t know where he put the credit for his record year. But it s easy \nto imagine it being skill and tal\u00adent plus a bit of luck. More likely that than luck plus a bit of skill \nand talent. It s a bit silly, then, to worry what it means for Roger Maris to have broken the record \n(first). In an important sense, it had nothing (much) to do with him. But we are wired to not be able \nto appreciate or perhaps even see that. Looking at Brunelleschi, the question occurs: Was he the Roger \nMaris of his time? Of the hundreds of cathedrals and their builders many perhaps attempting to achieve \nsomething marvellous were Santa Maria del Fiore and Brunelleschi simply outliers: just the right at bats \nduring the right year? Skill and talent play a role. Probability tells us that ev\u00adery batter has a normal \ndistribution of hitting achievement. The skill of the batter dictates where the mean (high point) of \nthat distribution lies. For someone of Roger Maris s skill, achieving 61 home runs in a year takes a \nlot of luck. If in\u00adstead of Maris s talent, we take Babe Ruth s with one home run every 11.3 at bats \n(instead of 12.8 for Maris) then were someone like Ruth to come along every 3 years, the chances of breaking \nthe 60 home run record in the 34 years between 1927 and 1961 would be 99.7%. For disciplines like writing \npoetry where talent seems to be at work, the practitioner can improve through practice, which has the \neffect of shifting the normal distribution to the right, increasing the aver\u00adage achievement. The other \nside of misperceiving randomness is how we assess the talent or skill of someone with achievements. The \nanswer is informed by an experiment conducted by Mi\u00adchael J. Lerner in the early 1960s [23]. In it, observers \nwere led to believe they were listening to 2 people (Tom and Bill) working together to solve anagrams. \nIn addition, they were told that, because of a budget problem, only one of the two anagram solvers was \nbeing paid, and that one by random selection. Instead of listening to an actual anagram-solving session, \nthe observers listened to a script being read that carefully showed the two solvers equally adept at \nthe task. Before watching Tom and Bill, though, the observers were broken into two groups. One group \nwas told that Tom had been randomly chosen to receive payment, and the other was told that Bill had been \nrandomly chosen; otherwise the two groups heard the same script being read. The observers in each group \nwere then asked to state which person (Tom or Bill) demonstrated the better effort, creativity, and success \nat the task. Overwhelming the groups chose the one they were told was paid, even though they knew that \nthe choice of who was paid was random. This means that judging whether someone is a hero depends substantially \non their reward or apparent achieve\u00adment, and not so much on actual skill or talent. This is why, I claim, \npeople generally consider the CEOs of successful companies as geniuses when their effects on their compa\u00adnies \nare usually minimal or insignificant. This is why Roger Maris must be better than Babe Ruth. Stories \nare the rest of it. Stories contain lessons or at least signposts you can follow. Not that a trail can \nt be fascinating, but with no protagonist, interest tends to fade fast. Some\u00adone to put yourself in the \nhead of; someone you can pretend to be. When you have a living (or once living) protagonist, you can \nengage in biography, and from biography you can pinpoint facts and turns that strike you as significant, \nstuff you can emulate. Want to save the world? become a B actor; want to win a slam-dunk contest? put \non Air Jordans. Maybe Fred Brooks paints chief designers with paint im\u00ad bued with the brightness of their \nachievements Lerner says that many of us do. Maybe Brooks finds it hard to attribute to luck and other \nfactors the creation of the extraordinary randomness has that effect on us. No matter; he remains a hero \nto me let him be human. Then there s this: when one mind can be solely respon\u00adsible for a masterpiece \nor success, you have hope. With a little luck, possibly, you can be that special mind. Like a winning \nlottery ticket floating down like the feather at the start of Forrest Gump falling at your feet waiting \nonly to be picked up and won with, that great idea could pop into your heard, turn up on your notepad, \ncome out of your mouth while you re just listening to yourself (this is where worse is better came from). \nMaybe it s not that easy, but maybe it s possible. Then you d be set, your career made, fortune gathered \nor fame cemented. Market share would be yours and . We crave heroes as an existence proof of our own \npotential. Or maybe we crave heroes to give us an excuse. When someone else is the hero, you don t have \nto be. When some\u00ad one else will be the genius, you can just be who you are. No need to try extra hard \nyou re not that Turing Award win\u00ad ner, that MacArthur Fellow, that writer with a published novel. And \nyou never will be. t The question, though, is conceptual integrity does it re\u00ad quire a single mind or \nsomething like it? A single mind, if anything, is likely to be too uncontrol\u00ad lable to produce conceptual \nintegrity at least in the arts. Recall T. S. Eliot: He does not know what he has to say until he has \nsaid it. Conceptual integrity comes from examin\u00ad ing in the case of poetry what you wrote and finding \nits beating heart, finding its center, its core, and making every\u00ad thing around it support it or else \ndisappear. Many times in writing, the eye and ear that can see clearly that heart are someone else s. \nOr else the thing created itself steps up, says hey, look here, I mean here. The heart of The Waste Land \nwas there to be found in Eliot s original manuscript, but that heart was obscured by 600+ other lines \nand the mistakes and weaknesses that Pound pointed out. The conceptual integrity of the poem did not \ncome from Eliot s mind what he produced was conceptually diffuse (Pound wrote in the margin: verse not \ninteresting enough as verse to warrant so much of it, too loose, and rhyme drags it out to diffuseness \n[24]). The poem s conceptual integrity was hidden within the draft embedded in gubbish, and when that \nwas cleared away the remainder was raw and Eliot with Pound s help discovered and strengthened it. The \nartifact supplies conceptual integrity more than any other collaborator, including the artist. The artist \nis the ve\u00ad hicle for noticing what the artifact shouts. The artist as any designer is is as great as \nhis or her ability to be a great and expert observer and crafty reporter. Christopher Alexander observed \nthis when he was de\u00ad signing the foot traffic through Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) ticket booths: What \nbothered me was that the correct analysis of the ticket booth could not be based purely on [the requirements], \nthat there were realities emerging from the system itself and that whether you suc\u00adceeded or not had \nto do with whether you created a configuration that was stable with respect to these realities. Christopher \nAlexander [25] And it s not so different for software. An initial prototype or first design/implementation \nis created that does some of the job. The parts that are useful are selected for in a Dar\u00ad winian sense, \nand finally (or next) the code is revised to reflect its central features, utility, and emerging structure \n [26]. The whole Alexandrian thing; the whole agile thing. Designed as designer. t The ingredients for \nconceptual integrity are these: the talent(s) of the human designer(s) all of them; the thing designed; \nthe luck that brought the designer(s) (and every\u00ad thing they needed) to the right place(s) at the right \ntime(s); the luck of the thing designed to have the right ingredi\u00ad ents. Eliot and Pound had talent; \nEliot s studies, travels, expe\u00ad riences, friendship with Pound, and Eliot and Pound being in France at \nthe same time were fortuitous; Eliot s draft was fortunate that enough good stuff was there for Pound \nto see. Luck and randomness go against the grain of human cognition; it s hard to see the role of the \nthing designed in its own design; and thus typically only talent is given credit for great achievement. \nt Morning floods Firenze the sun stains roofs, heat and smoke clog the sky in red. Emilio is long awake \nand before his mother begins cooking he turns onto his side in his rough bed and tries to picture the \nstucco fa\u00e7ade of the Duomo and its faded decorative paintings. How such a cathedral the glory of Brunelleschi \ncould be allowed to endure 500 years without a proper face makes him sad. Today if his mother allows \nand there is time after his chores before the sun goes down, he will go to the plaza and make some sketches \nmaybe make some watercolors later get some ideas down. He hopes someone, one day a great genius perhaps \nwill be able to plan the fa\u00e7ade, maybe see it built, and the cathedral will be completed. t In 1975, \ntwo young computer scientists at MIT began to puzzle out the then-peculiar theory of actors developed \nby Carl Hewitt [27]. Hewitt s model was object-oriented influenced by Smalltalk following a historic \nseminar given by Alan Kay at MIT in November 1972. In the theory, every actor (object) is computationally \nactive and can send and receive messages, which themselves are actors. An actor has a set of acquaintances \nit can send messages to, including messages containing acquaintances. The two young computer scientists: \ntheir methodology was to construct a tiny Lisp interpreter for a toy Lisp and then to extend it to create \nactors and send messages. The two were Gerry Sussman and Guy Steele, and the toy Lisp became known as \nScheme [28]. Because Sussman was study\u00ading Algol [29] at the time, they decided to build a Lisp with \nlexical scoping and anyway, this seemed necessary to keep track of an actor s acquaintances. Here is \nhow the simple factorial function was written in their toy Lisp: (define factorial (lambda (n) (if (= \nn 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))) And here is the equivalent actor: (define actorial (alpha (n c) \n(if (= n 0) (c 1) (actorial (- n 1) (alpha (f) (c (* f n))))))) Here n is the (numeric) argument to actorial, \nand c is the continuation the computation to perform after the one described in this definition. The \nvalues of n and c passed in via a message become acquaintances of the inner con\u00adtinuation actor created \nby alpha. Let me now quote Guy Steele writing in The Evolution of Lisp [30]: Then came a crucial discovery \none that, to us, illustrates the value of experimentation in language design. On inspecting the code \nfor apply, once they got it working correctly, Sussman and Steele were astonished to discover that the \ncodes in apply for function application and for actor invocation were identical! Further inspection of \nother parts of the interpreter, such as the code for creating functions and actors, confirmed this insight: \nthe fact that functions were intended to return values and ac\u00ad tors were not made no difference anywhere \nin their implementation. The difference lay purely in the primitives used to code their bodies. If the \nunder\u00ad lying primitives return values, then the user can write functions that return values; if all primitives \nexpect continuations, then the user can write ac\u00ad tors. But the lambda and alpha mechanisms were themselves \nidentical, and from this Sussman and Steele concluded that actors and closures were the same concept. \nSteele &#38; Gabriel [30] They used the word discover, and that s what it s called in most scientific \ndisciplines. Perhaps scientists construct statements in a formal language to express (an approxima\u00adtion \nof) each discovery, but na\u00efve realism asks us to believe that the truth is there to be found. Sussman \nand Steele de\u00adsigned and constructed a working programming language. That language and its realization \nin code running in Mac Lisp [31] on a PDP-10 [32] taught them about programming language concepts, and \nhelped them refine the language (its design) and its implementation to become one of the more important \nresearch languages in computer science over the last 30 years. Perhaps Sussman and Steele knew, somehow, \nthat actors and closures were the same when they started to write the code. The code, though, needed \nto speak to bring it to their attention. Or maybe, just as Steele said, they didn t know. That what they \nwrite teaches is no news to poets &#38; writ\u00aders. t He won the competition to design the fa\u00e7ade in 1871, \nand oversaw the beginning of its construction. Red, green, and white marble, neo-gothic, though a bit \nover-decorated. His was the third fa\u00e7ade on the cathedral, the first designed by Arnolfo di Cambio, the \nsecond a painting over stucco by no one worth remembering. He was mild, gentle, unassertive, and mostly \nself educated; many believed his success lay in the sympathy which every one instinctively felt for his \nkindly nature, and in the gentle tenacity with which he adhered to his opinions while avoiding all open \nantagonisms [33]. For years he studied the architecture of the Italian gothic period and especially the \nDuomo, and he learned or should I say, the Duomo taught him what the fa\u00e7ade needed. Like Brunelleschi \nhe never saw the construction of his design completed. Emilio de Fabris designer of the west\u00adern face \nof Santa Maria del Fiore, as important as anyone to the creation of the Duomo in Florence, but someone \nyou likely have never heard of died on June 28, 1883.
