Presented in this paper is a staged, high-level alias analysis methodology that provides detailed alias information to a global optimizer implemented at any level in the compilation process. The framework provides easy portability of optimizing compilers to new architectures, as well as the easy addition, of new compilers to an already existing family of optimizing compilers. The method involves the application of a set of language-specific alias rules to the source code in order to gather alias information. A language-independent component then performs a transitive closure of this information and transforms it into a presentation more suitable for use by a global optimizer. Each stage of the methodology is detailed. Results are given for an implemented family of compilers targeted for a reduced instruction set computer.", "authors": [{"name": "Deborah S.
