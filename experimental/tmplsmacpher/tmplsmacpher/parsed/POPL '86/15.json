It is shown that, by imposing the crucial condition of &lt;i&gt;finite variability,&lt;/i&gt; we achieve a balanced formalism that is insensitive to &lt;i&gt;finite&lt;/i&gt; stuttering, but can recognize &lt;i&gt;infinite&lt;/i&gt; stuttering, a distinction which is essential for obtaining a fully abstract semantics of non-terminating processes. Among other advantages, going into real-based semantics obviates the need for the controversial representation of concurrency by interleaving, and most of the associated fairness constraints.", "authors": [{"name": "Howard Barringer", "author_profile_id": "81100464829", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP17001460", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ruurd Kuiper", "author_profile_id": "81343497811", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP45024925", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Amir Pnueli", "author_profile_id": "81100648459", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP15038449", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/512644.512660", "year": "1986", "article_id": "512660", "conference": "POPL", "title": "A really abstract concurrent model and its temporal logic", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=512660"}
