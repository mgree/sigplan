Our results significantly extend the applicability of program verification and synthesis methods based on propositional temporal logic.", "authors": [{"name": "Pierre Wolper", "author_profile_id": "81100141337", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP39029432", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/512644.512661", "year": "1986", "article_id": "512661", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Expressing interesting properties of programs in propositional temporal logic", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=512661"}
