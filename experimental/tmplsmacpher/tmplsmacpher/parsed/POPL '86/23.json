In this paper we propose that programs in such languages be viewed as rewrite rules that hierarchically decompose a process into a network of distributed processes. Logical variables and unification provide a powerful means of communication, and annotations can provide a synchronization mechanism that complements them.", "authors": [{"name": "Raghu Ramakrishnan", "author_profile_id": "81100290062", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP40025731", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Abraham Silberschatz", "author_profile_id": "81410592755", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP77041403", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/512644.512668", "year": "1986", "article_id": "512668", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Annotations for distributed programming in logic", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=512668"}
