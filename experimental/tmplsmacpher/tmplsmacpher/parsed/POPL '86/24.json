In languages with abstract data type declarations, representation independence should hold for user-defined types as well as built-in types. We study the representation independence properties of a typed functional language (second-order lambda calculus) with polymorphic functions and abstract data type declarations in which data type implementations (packages) may be passed as function parameters and returned as results. The type checking rules of the language guarantee that two data type implementations P and Q are equivalence whenever there is a correspondence between the behavior of the operations of P and the behavior of the operations of Q.", "authors": [{"name": "John C.
