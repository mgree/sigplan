In addition, the ability to reason about equations, which is not provided by Prolog, can be accommodated by equational languages. In this paper, we propose an extended equational programming paradigm, and describe an &lt;i&gt;equational logic&lt;/i&gt; programming language which is an extension of the equational language defined in [Hoff82]. Semantic foundations for the extension are discussed. The extended language is a powerful logic programming language in the sense of Prolog and thus enjoys the programming features that Prolog possesses. Furthermore, it provides an ability to solve equations, which captures the essential power of equational programming.", "authors": [{"name": "Jia-Huai You", "author_profile_id": "81100561096", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP14194780", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "P.
