A non-trivial case study is carried through, illustrating the facilities that a design language could have for setting and deleting the knowledge that the processes possess about the global state and about the knowledge of other processes. No implicit capabilities for logical reasoning are assumed. A language basis is used that allows common knowledge not only by an eager protocol but also in the true sense. The observation is made that the distinction between these two kinds of common knowledge can be associated with the level of abstraction: true common knowledge of higher levels of abstraction: true common knowledge of higher levels can be implemented as eager common knowledge on lower levels. A knowledge-motivated abstraction tool is therefore suggested to be useful in supporting stepwise refinement of distributed algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "Reino Kurki-Suonio", "author_profile_id": "81332510605", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP43124614", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/512644.512657", "year": "1986", "article_id": "512657", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Towards programming with knowledge expressions", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=512657"}
