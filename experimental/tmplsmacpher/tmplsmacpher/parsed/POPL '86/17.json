{"article_publication_date": "01-01-1986", "fulltext": "\n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "512644", "abstract": "In this paper the semantics of the programming language POOL is described. It is a language that integrates the object-oriented structure of languages like Smalltalk-80 with facilities for concurrency and communication like the ones in Ada. The semantics is described in an operational way; it is based on transition systems. By using a way of representing parallel processes that is different from the traditional one, it is possible to overcome some difficulties pertaining to the latter. The resulting semantics shows a close resemblance with the informal language description and at the same time there are good prospects that it can serve as a secure guide for the implementation of the language. Also a variant is given in which more and maximal parallelism can be expressed in a very natural way.", "authors": [{"name": "Pierre America", "author_profile_id": "81100388936", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP39040615", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jaco de Bakker", "author_profile_id": "81100122491", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P130777", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Joost N.
