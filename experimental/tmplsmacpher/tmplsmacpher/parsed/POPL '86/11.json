The goal of &lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; is to help programmers in seeking efficient parallel implementations of an algorithm, and managing the complexity that might arise in dealing with hundreds of thousands of autonomous parallel processes. In &lt;b&gt;Crystal,&lt;/b&gt; a program consists of a system of recursion equations and is interpreted as a parallel system. &lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; views a large complex system as consisting of a hierarchy of parallel sub-systems, built upon a set of &lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; programs by composition and abstraction. There is no mention of explicit communications in a &lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; program. The &lt;b&gt;Crystal&lt;/b&gt; compiler automatically incorporates pipelining into programs, and generates a parallel program that is optimal with respect to an algorithm. Each optimizing compiler, targeted for a particular machine, determines the appropriate granular size of parallelism and attains a balance between computations and communications. Based on the language, a unified theory for understanding and generating any systolic design has been devised and it constitues a part of the compiler.", "authors": [{"name": "Marina C.
