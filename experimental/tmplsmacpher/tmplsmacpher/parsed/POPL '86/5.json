The usual definition of attribute grammars is extended: the cycles that occur in VLSI design make us come to terms with circular attributes (under conditions that guarantee their least fixpoint solution, namely that the functions be monotone and yield values over a lattice of bounded height). Many interesting VLSI design problems can be cast in attributes meeting this condition, for example, timing verification, logic simulation, power dissipation, and adherence to clocking disciplines, to name a few. As an illustration of the formalism, attributes are presented which solve the All Bidirectional Edges problem that labels the direction of information flow in a circuit. The incremental evaluation algorithm of [Rep82] is extended to handle fixpoint computations of circular attributes by noting that when the dependency graph is broken into its strongly connected components, a directed acyclic graph results. The worst-case running time of the resulting incremental evaluation algorithm is bounded by &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;hk&lt;/i&gt; |AFFECTEDSCC|), where &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt; is the height of the largest attribute lattice, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; the largest number of attributes in any one strongly connected component, and |AFFECTEDSCC| the number of strongly connected components affected by a single modification to the design tree.", "authors": [{"name": "Larry G.
