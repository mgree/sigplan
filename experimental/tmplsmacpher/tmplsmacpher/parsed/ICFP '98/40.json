E-mail: {daniel,fidel,valter)Olifia.info.unlp.edu.ar \nUR.L: http://wwv-lifia.info.mrlp.edu.ar/ Hypermedia authoring pie951 faces numerous challenges today. \nThe expansive growth of the WWW and the increas- ing accesibility to multimedia technologies have made \nhy-permedia preferable to traditional media. As expected, this growth has risen the requirements for \ntools which ease the hypermedia-generation process. While naive approaches to authoring consist in using \nWYSIWYG tools directly -de-sign and implementation is done in a unique phase -, a more structured approach \nis needed when authoring in-the-large. Several methodologies were proposed for systematic hy-permedia \ndesign. Methodologies make a clear separation between the different phases in the hypermedia generation \nprocess (conceptual design, navigational design, implemen- tation, etc.) -see for example pSB95, SR95]. \nA common feature of these methodologies is the sepa-ration between the design and the implementation \nof the hypermedia application. In [FNNQB], it is argued that these approaches can leave a wide gap between \ninitial de-sign and iinal production. Consequently, design problems are detected very late and can be \nvery expensive to fix. In [FNNQG, NN95] it is stated that, while a structured approach is necessary, \nlow-cost prototyping is also very important for early evaluation of hypermedias. Functional Programming \n(FP for short) offers a number of advantages to programmers [BWSS, Hug89]. It features a high level of \nabstraction, modularity and a con&#38;e declar-ative style which makes programs easy to read and under- \nstand. An attractive feature of FP is that it allows program-mers to map their ideas almost directly \nto functional code, bridging the gap between specification and implementation. This work presents HyCom \n(Hypermedia Combinators), an hypermedia-authoring framework based in the functional language H&#38;cell \n[PH+97]. HyCom provides constructions to specify navigational structures (nodes, links) and inter-face \nissues in an abstract, platform-independent way, in a style similar to that in [vDMQB]. HyCom uses transformers \nand combinators -a programming technique widely used in FP [HugQS, FJQ6, Hud96] -to express relationships \nbetween hypermedia components. HyCom offers several attractive features. On one hand, a functional language \nis used as a hypermedia-specification language, and thus authors benefit from FP s well-known expressiveness. \nOn the other hand, using FP provides a high-abstraction level in the design process, and also allows \na modular, structured approach to design. Furthermore, hypermedia designs expressed in HyCom can be automatically \nrendered to WWW pages or other platforms, by using appropiate rendering functions -thus prototyping and \nfinal implementation involves no additional effort from the author. This is a consequence of the short \ndistance between specification and implementation obtained by using FP. We propose using a FP-based framework \nfor specifying and building hypermedias. We think this is an interest-ing proposal, since FP expressiveness \nis well-suited for ab stract specifications, which indeed can be translated almost directly to working \nimplementations -a desirable feature for achieving low-cost prototyping. Furthermore, we think this is \nan original contribution, since the hypermedia field has been traditionally distant from FP. References \n[BIOS] M. Bleber and T. Iaakowits, editors.
