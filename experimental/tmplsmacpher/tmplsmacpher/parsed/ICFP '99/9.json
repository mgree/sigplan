In particular, we highlight our use of Haskell's lazy lists, type classes, lazy state monad, and unsafe Perform I0, and point to several areas where Haskell could be improved in the future. We end with an example of a benefit gained by bringing the functional perspective to microarchitectural modelling.", "authors": [{"name": "John Launchbury", "author_profile_id": "81100462557", "affiliation": "Oregon Graduate Institute of Science & Technology", "person_id": "PP39043890", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jeffrey R.
