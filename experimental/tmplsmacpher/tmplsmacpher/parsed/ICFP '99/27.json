Inductively sequential programs admit the definition of optimal computation strategies and are the basis of several recent (lazy) functional logic languages. In this paper, we define a partial evaluator for inductively sequential functional logic programs. We prove strong correctness of this partial evaluator and show that the nice properties of inductively sequential programs carry over to the specialization process and the specialized programs. In particular, the structure of the programs is preserved by the specialization process. This is in contrast to other partial evaluation methods for functional logic programs which can destroy the original program structure. Finally, we present some experiments which highlight the practical advantages of our approach.", "authors": [{"name": "Mar&#237;a Alpuente", "author_profile_id": "81100138666", "affiliation": "DSIC, UPV, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain", "person_id": "P187191", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Michael Hanus", "author_profile_id": "81100022601", "affiliation": "Informatik II, RWTH Aachen, D-52056 Aachen, Germany", "person_id": "PP39023636", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Salvador Lucas", "author_profile_id": "81100597340", "affiliation": "DSIC, UPV, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain", "person_id": "PP40036003", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Germ&#225;n Vidal", "author_profile_id": "81100420507", "affiliation": "DSIC, UPV, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain", "person_id": "PP39041997", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/317636.317910", "year": "1999", "article_id": "317910", "conference": "ICFP", "title": "Specialization of inductively sequential functional logic programs", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=317910"}
