Short cut deforestation is a deforestation method which is based on a single, local transformation rule. In return, short cut deforestation expects both producer and consumer of the intermediate structure in a certain form. Warm fusion wan proposed to automatically transform functions into this form. Unfortunately, it is costly and hard to implement. Starting from the fact that short cut deforestation is based on a parametricity theorem of the second-order typed &amp;lambda;-calculus, we show how the required form of a list producer can be derived by the use of type inference. Typability for the second-order typed &amp;lambda;-calculus is undecidable. However, we present a linear-time algorithm that solves a partial type inference problem and that, together with controlled inlining and polymorphic type instantiation, suffices for deforestation. The resulting new short cut deforestation algorithm is efficient and removes more intermediate lists than the original.", "authors": [{"name": "Olaf Chitil", "author_profile_id": "81100243192", "affiliation": "Lehrstuhl f&#252;r Informatik II, RWTH Aachen, 52056 Aachen, Germany", "person_id": "PP14093711", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/317636.317907", "year": "1999", "article_id": "317907", "conference": "ICFP", "title": "Typer inference builds a short cut to deforestation", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=317907"}
