We describe the key elements of the MrEd virtual machine for building a programming environment, and we step through the implementation of a miniature version of DrScheme in MrEd. More generally, we show how MrEd defines a high-level operating system for graphical programs.", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew Flatt", "author_profile_id": "81100490544", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Houston, Texas", "person_id": "PP39045354", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Robert Bruce Findler", "author_profile_id": "81100028925", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Houston, Texas", "person_id": "PP14022884", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Shriram Krishnamurthi", "author_profile_id": "81100512233", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Houston, Texas", "person_id": "PP39074578", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Matthias Felleisen", "author_profile_id": "81100323458", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Houston, Texas", "person_id": "PP39037684", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/317636.317793", "year": "1999", "article_id": "317793", "conference": "ICFP", "title": "Programming languages as operating systems (<italic>or</italic> revenge of the son of the lisp machine)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=317793"}
