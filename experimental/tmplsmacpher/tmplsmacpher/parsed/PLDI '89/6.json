Mul-T is an extended version of the Yale T system and uses the T system's ORBIT compiler to achieve &#8220;production quality&#8221; performance on stock hardware &#8212; about 100 times faster than Multilisp. Mul-T shows that futures can be implemented cheaply enough to be useful in a production-quality system. Mul-T is fully operational, including a user interface that supports managing groups of parallel tasks.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "D. A.
