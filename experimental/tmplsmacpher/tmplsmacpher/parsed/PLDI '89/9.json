Benchmark results show that TIGRE's execution speed compares quite favorably with previous combinator-graph reduction techniques on similar hardware. Furthermore, the mapping of TIGRE onto conventional hardware is simple and efficient. Mainframe implementations of TIGRE provide performance levels exceeding those previously available on custom graph reduction hardware.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "P. J.
