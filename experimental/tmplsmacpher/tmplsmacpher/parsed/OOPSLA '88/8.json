Traditionally, the application is bundled with an image including the entire development environment. Production applications frequently require that the only interface visible to the end user be that of the application. A common misperception among Smalltalk-80 application developers is that it is impossible to:<list><item><p>develop and deliver applications containing proprietary algorithms,</p></item><item><p>prevent inspection and modification of the application,</p></item><item><p>separate the development environment from the delivered application,</p></item><item><p>provide annotation of the application classes and methods without actually revealing the source code to the end user.</p></item></list></p><p>In this paper, we introduce various techniques and mechanisms for meeting these requirements.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "S.
