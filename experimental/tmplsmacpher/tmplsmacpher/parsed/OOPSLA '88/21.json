Its aim is in dealing with knowledge representation issues in pattern recognition. In our approach, everything works in an entirely autonomous and decentralized manner. Even a search procedure for sample-concept matching is distributed onto every concept object itself by being implemented in what we introduced as the recursive agent-blackboard model. We developed an experimental prototype of character recognition systems in Smalltalk-80, which proved the ability of the object-oriented framework and the cooperative search procedure.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Norihiko Yoshida", "author_profile_id": "81546797856", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Kyushu University, Hakozaki.
