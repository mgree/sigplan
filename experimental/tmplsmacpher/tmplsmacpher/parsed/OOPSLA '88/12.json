One is the language issue: an object-oriented programming language must be augmented with semantic data modeling concepts to provide a robust set of data modeling concepts to allow modeling of entities for important real-world applications. Another is the computational-model issue: application programmers should be able to access and manipulate objects as though the objects are in an infinite virtual memory; in other words, they should not have to be aware of the existence of a database system in their computations with the data structures the programming language allows. This paper discusses these issues and presents the solutions which we have incorporated into the ORION object-oriented database system at MCC.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Won Kim", "author_profile_id": "81414607972", "affiliation": "Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, 3500 West Balcones Center Drive, Austin, Texas", "person_id": "PP92029005", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Nat Ballou", "author_profile_id": "81100507376", "affiliation": "Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, 3500 West Balcones Center Drive, Austin, Texas", "person_id": "P207471", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jay Banerjee", "author_profile_id": "81100144485", "affiliation": "Unisys Corporation, P.O.
