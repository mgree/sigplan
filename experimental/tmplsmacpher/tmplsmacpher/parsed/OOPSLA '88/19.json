OFMspert is an architecture for an intelligent operator's associate. In order to verify the architecture, an OFMspert was implemented to act as an assistant to an operator of a NASA satellite ground control system. OFMspert is a large system that utilizes a Smalltalk implementation of a knowledge-based problem solving method known as the blackboard architecture. The entire system was designed and implemented in Smalltalk/V#8482; and later ported to the Smalltalk-80#8482; system. The object-oriented paradigm in general, and Smalltalk&Dagger; in particular, greatly facilitated the rapid design and implementation of this system. This paper summarizes the OFMspert architecture, emphasizing its implementation in an object-oriented paradigm.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Kenneth S.
