We first discuss our notion of <italic>reflection</italic> in object-oriented <italic>concurrent</italic> computation and then present a reflective object-oriented concurrent language ABCL/R. We give several illustrative examples of reflective programming such as (1) dynamic concurrent acquisition of &#8220;methods&#8221; from other objects, (2) monitoring the behavior of concurrently running objects, and (3) augmentation of the time warp mechanism to a concurrent system. Also the definition of a meta-circular interpreter of this language is given as the definition of a meta-object. The language ABCL/R has been implemented. All the examples given in this paper are running on our ABCL/R system.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Takuo Watanabe", "author_profile_id": "81100364022", "affiliation": "Department of Information Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152, Japan", "person_id": "P278103", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Akinori Yonezawa", "author_profile_id": "81100439203", "affiliation": "Department of Information Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152, Japan", "person_id": "PP15032269", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/62083.62111", "year": "1988", "article_id": "62111", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Reflection in an object-oriented concurrent language", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=62111"}
