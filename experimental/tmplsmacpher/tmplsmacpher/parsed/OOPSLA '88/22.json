The data abstraction mechanism described here has been devised in the context of the design of Sina/st language. In Sina/st no language constructs have been adopted for specifying inheritance or delegation, but rather, we introduce simpler mechanisms that can support a wide range of code sharing strategies without selecting one among them as a language feature. Sina/st also provides a stronger data encapsulation than most of the existing object-oriented languages. This language has been implemented on the SUN 3 workstation using Smalltalk.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Mehmet Aksit", "author_profile_id": "81100296736", "affiliation": "University of Twente, Department of Computer Science, Enschede, the Netherlands", "person_id": "PP39036498", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Anand Tripathi", "author_profile_id": "81405593427", "affiliation": "University of Minnesota, Department of Computer Science, Minneapolis, MN", "person_id": "PP14209167", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/62083.62107", "year": "1988", "article_id": "62107", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Data abstraction mechanisms in SINA/ST", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=62107"}
