Coral (Constraint-based Object-oriented Relations And Language) is a new user interface toolkit under development that uses efficiently-implemented constraints to support these relationships. Using Coral, user interface designers can construct interaction techniques such as menus and scroll bars. More importantly, Coral makes it easy to construct direct-manipulation user interfaces specialized to particular applications. Unlike previous constraint-based toolkits, Coral supports defining constraints in the abstract, and then applying them to different object instances. In addition, it provides iteration constructs where lists of items (such as those used in menus) can be constrained as a group. Coral has two interfaces: a declarative interface that provides a convenient way to specify the desired constraints, and a procedural interface that will allow a graphical user interface management system (UIMS) to automatically create Coral calls.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Pedro Szekely", "author_profile_id": "81100625746", "affiliation": "Computer-Science Department, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA", "person_id": "PP14215530", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Brad Myers", "author_profile_id": "81100013136", "affiliation": "Computer-Science Department, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA", "person_id": "P31916", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/62083.62088", "year": "1988", "article_id": "62088", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "A user interface toolkit based on graphical objects and constraints", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=62088"}
