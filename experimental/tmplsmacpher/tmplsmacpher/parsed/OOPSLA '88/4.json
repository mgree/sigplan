The architecture of ET++ is based on MacApp and integrates a rich collection of user interface building blocks as well as basic data structures to form a homogeneous and extensible system. The paper describes the graphic model and its underlying abstract window system interface, shows composite objects as a substrate for declarative layout specification of complex dialogs, and presents a model for editable text allowing the integration of arbitrary interaction objects.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Andre Weinand", "author_profile_id": "81100573736", "affiliation": "Institute for Informatics, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstr. 190, CI-I-8057 Zurich, Switzerland", "person_id": "P17041", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Erich Gamma", "author_profile_id": "81100094240", "affiliation": "Institute for Informatics, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstr. 190, CI-I-8057 Zurich, Switzerland", "person_id": "P78640", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Rudolf Marty", "author_profile_id": "81332514398", "affiliation": "Institute for Informatics, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstr. 190, CI-I-8057 Zurich, Switzerland", "person_id": "PP14103633", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/62083.62089", "year": "1988", "article_id": "62089", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "ET++&#8212;an object oriented application framework in C++", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=62089"}
