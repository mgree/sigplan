Kyma draws no distinctions between the materials and the structure of a composition; both are Sound objects. When a Sound object receives a message to play, it transforms itself into a microSound object, i.e. an object representation of itself in the microcode of the Platypus. Thus an object paradigm is used not only in the representation of Sound objects in Smalltalk-80 but also in the microcode representation of those Sound objects on the Platypus</italic>.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "C.
