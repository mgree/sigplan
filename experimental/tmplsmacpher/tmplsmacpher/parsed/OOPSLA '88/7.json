This window system uses constraints to specify attributes of windows and relationships between them. Three classes of constraints are supported, one of which is implicit and not available for general use. The system extends the current Smalltalk system, providing support for both fixed-size and fixed-scale windows. It also provides the capability to dynamically reorganize the layout of a window. A goal of the design is to produce a system with real-time response that is fast enough to be substituted for the existing system. A prototype with response times of approximately 1/4 second has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the design as well as to point out several important optimizations.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Danny Epstein", "author_profile_id": "81100241752", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science, Carleton University, Ottawa Ontario, Canada K1S 5B6", "person_id": "P59704", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Wilf R.
