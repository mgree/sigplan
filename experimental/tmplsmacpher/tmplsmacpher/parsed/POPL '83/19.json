Such algorithms enable programmers to use a high-level, data-driven programming language without forfeiting the efficiency of a synchronous machine. We characterize loop programs for which conversion is possible in terms of sets of balancing equations and we present two conversion algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "Janice E.
