Here \"language\" is used in its traditional sense as referring to a set of interpreted expressions. We are concerned with the syntax of an expression only to the degree needed to relate its structure to its \"meaning\". A clear distinction is drawn between a \"language\" and the many possible \"realizations\" of that language.This introduction comprises a survey and opinionated discussion of the contents of the paper, therefore the reader who wishes to get on with the technical exposition can skip to the next section.", "authors": [{"name": "John Backus", "author_profile_id": "81100233661", "affiliation": "IBM Research Laboratory, San Jose, California", "person_id": "PP14091186", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/512927.512934", "year": "1973", "article_id": "512934", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Programming language semantics and closed applicative languages", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=512934"}
