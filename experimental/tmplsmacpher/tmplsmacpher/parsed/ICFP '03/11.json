{"article_publication_date": "08-25-2003", "fulltext": "\n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "944705", "abstract": "We give a tutorial and first-principles description of the <i>context semantics</i> of Gonthier, Abadi, and L&#233;vy [5, 4], a computer-science analogue of Girard's <i>geometry of interaction</i> [3]. In the spirit of the invited presentation of Tom Knight (see this Proceedings [7]), the semantics is reversible, and supports pseudo-quantum computation via a superposed sharing of terms and evaluation contexts [2].Context semantics provides a mechanism for modelling ?-calculus, and more generally multiplicative-exponential linear logic (MELL); we explain the the call-by-name (CBN) coding of the ?-calculus, and sketch a proof of the correctness of <i>readback</i>, where the normal form of a ?-term is recovered from its semantics. This analysis yields the algorithmic correctness of Lamping's optimal reduction algorithm [8]. We relate the context semantics to linear logic types and to ideas from <i>game semantics</i>, used to prove full abstraction theorems for PCF and other ?-calculus variants [1, 6, 10]. Readback is essentially a game played by an environment (the Opponent) who wants to discover the <i>B&#246;hm tree</i> (normal form) of a term known by a Player. A <i>type</i> plays the role---using the games jargon---of an <i>arena</i> of possible <i>moves</i>, and a <i>term</i> of that type provides a <i>winning strategy</i> for the Player, permitting the Player to respond correctly to moves made by the Opponent. The interaction between Opponent and Player describes a perfect flow analysis which answers questions like, \"can call site a ever call procedure p?\" The context semantics provides a low-level coding mechanism for describing such flows, the positions of subexpressions and head variables in B&#246;hm trees, as well as moves in the above described two-player games.", "authors": [{"name": "Harry G.
