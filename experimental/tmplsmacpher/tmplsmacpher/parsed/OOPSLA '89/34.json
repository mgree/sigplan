The polling loops consume CPU cycles even when the user is not interacting with the interface. Applications using Smalltalk as their front-end often suffer unnecessary performance loss. This paper presents a prototype event-driven MVC framework to solve these problems. A solution to the compatibility problem is also provided to allow interface objects built under both polling and event-driven mechanisms to be used by each other with no modification and no performance penalty.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Y.-P.
