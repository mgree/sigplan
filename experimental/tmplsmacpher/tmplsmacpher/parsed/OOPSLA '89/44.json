Recent studies show that method inheritance can be nicely supported by ML style type inference when extended to labeled records. This is based on the fact that a function that selects a field &fnof; of a record can be given a polymorphic type that enables it to be applied to any record which contains a field &fnof;. Several type systems also provide data abstraction through abstract type declarations. However, these two features have not yet been properly integrated in a statically checked polymorphic type system.</p><p>This paper proposes a static type system that achieves this integration in an ML-like polymorphic language by adding a class construct that allows the programmer to build a hierarchy of classes connected by multiple inheritance declarations. Moreover, classes can be parameterized by types allowing &#8220;generic&#8221; definitions. The type correctness of class declarations is statically checked by the type system. The type system also infers a principal scheme for any type correct program containing methods and objects defined in classes.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "A.
