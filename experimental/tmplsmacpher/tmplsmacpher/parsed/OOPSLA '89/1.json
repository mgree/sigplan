These verbal protocols were recorded and examined for ways in which the programmers' understanding of the problem domain affected the design process; most of our examples are from the three Smalltalk programmers who focussed most on the mapping from problem to solution. We characterize the problem entities that did appear as solution objects, the active nature of the mapping process, and ways in which the resultant objects went beyond their problem analogs.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "M.
