We generalize the treatment of slots to include frame-like semantics; in addition we allow slots to be referenced by complex terms, whereas previously described frame based systems typically allow only scalar slot references. The resulting frame system naturally accommodates complex data structures and provides an extremely powerful mechanism for specifying complex relationships between objects represented by frames.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "F.
