The full benefit of this support can only be realized if encapsulation is maximized during the design process.</p><p>We argue that design practices which take a data-driven approach fail to maximize encapsulation because they focus too quickly on the implementation of objects. We propose an alternative object-oriented design method which takes a responsibility-driven approach. We show how such an approach can increase the encapsulation by deferring implementation issues until a later stage.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "R.
