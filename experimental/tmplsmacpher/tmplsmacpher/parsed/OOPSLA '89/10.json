We present a reflective extension of the actor model to implement inheritance mechanisms within the actor model. We demonstrate that a particularly expressive and inheritable synchronization mechanism must support local reasoning, be composable, be first-class, and allow parameterization based on message content. We present such a mechanism based on the concept of <italic>enabled-sets</italic>, and illustrate each property. We have implemented enabled-sets in the Rosette prototyping testbed.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "C.
