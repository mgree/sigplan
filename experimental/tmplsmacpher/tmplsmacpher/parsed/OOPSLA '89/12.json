Playground is a child-oriented programming language that uses objects to structure data and has a modular control structure, a direct-manipulation user interface, and an English-like syntax. Integrating Playground into the curriculum of a classroom of 9- to 10-year-olds has given us valuable insights from the programs intended users, and confirmed many of our design decisions.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "J.
