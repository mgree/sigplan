The addressing techniques are responsible for the efficient implementation of record field selection. In object-oriented languages, this record selection is equivalent to the access of methods. Thus, the efficiency of these techniques greatly affects the overall performance of an object-oriented language. We will demonstrate that addresses, in such systems, cannot always be calculated statically and show how symbol tables have been used as address maps at run time. The essence of the paper is a new addressing technique that can statically calculate either the address of a field or the address of the address of the field. This technique is powerful enough to support an efficient implementation of multiple inheritance with implicit subtyping as described by Cardelli.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "R. C. H.
