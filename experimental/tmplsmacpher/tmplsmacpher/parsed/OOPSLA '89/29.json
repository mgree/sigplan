Our work on OROS is predicated on the hypothesis that a type model, incorporated into an environment's object manager, can contribute to achieving those goals. This paper reports on an attempt at applying object-oriented typing concepts in the domain of software development environments. We believe that the result is a type model that has properties of interest both to software environment builders and also to builders and users of object-oriented systems in general.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "W.
