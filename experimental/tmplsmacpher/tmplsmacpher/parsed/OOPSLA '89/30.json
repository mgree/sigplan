Consequently, they have been widely used in languages such as Smalltalk-80 or more recently CLOS by both users and implementers. Due to their powerful control of instances, careless inheritance of classes with different metaclasses can lead to unsound or inefficient implementations of instance methods. Using examples, we will pin-point these problems. Then we will introduce compatibility rules which need to be fulfilled by metaclasses of inherited classes in order to allow reasonable instance method description.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "N.
