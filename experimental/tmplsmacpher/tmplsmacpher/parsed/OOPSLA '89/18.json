Aldus developed Vamp as a practical experiment in solving several software engineering and project management problems including software reusability, portability, and management of large program teams. Vamp is written in C ++ to run on the Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. This paper discusses the decisions that led to the architecture of Vamp and what Aldus stands to gain by its use.</italic></p>", "authors": [{"name": "P. J.
