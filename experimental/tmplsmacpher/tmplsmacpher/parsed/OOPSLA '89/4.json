This algorithm collects distributed garbage incrementally and concurrently with user activity. It is the first incremental algorithm that is capable of collecting <italic>cyclic</italic> distributed garbage. Computational and network communication overhead are acceptable. Hosts may be temporarily inaccessible and synchronization between hosts is not necessary. The algorithm is based on asynchronous distribution of timestamp packets each containing a list of last-access times of some relevant remotely referenced objects. Finally, the correctness and time complexity of the algorithm are discussed.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "M.
