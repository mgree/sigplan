Because of their age, such systems are likely to have been implemented in a conventional language with limited use of data abstraction or encapsulation. The lack of abstraction complicates adding new applications to such systems and the lack of encapsulation impedes modifying the system because applications depend on system internals. We describe our experience providing and using an object-oriented interface to a legacy system.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "W. C.
