Classes for scientific visualization, including contour plotting and 3D surface representations which incorporate the model-view-controller paradigm are presented. Techniques for inclusion of user primitives written in C to support computationally intense methods are described in detail in their current implementation on advanced Smalltalk workstations (SUN4, Ardent Titan, Tektronix 4317).</p>", "authors": [{"name": "S.
