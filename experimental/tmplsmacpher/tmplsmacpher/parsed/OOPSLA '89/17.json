To show how straightforward application of object-oriented design to standard algorithms in numerical linear algebra improves clarity and expressiveness, without sacrificing speed or accuracy, I describe parts of Cactus, a system for numerical linear algebra and constrained optimization, implemented in Common Lisp and CLOS.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "J.
