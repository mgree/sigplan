The system is analyzed along several relevant dimensions. PCLOS provides object persistence for an object-oriented language. The insights gained on desirable and detrimental components of the system are presented. The intent is to outline some of the expected and unexpected problems encountered in the construction of support for object persistence.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "A.
