Most designers reject general purpose conferencing tools for not meeting their needs, and feature-rich distributed CASE tools for being too formal. Our long-term goal is to develop effective tools for distributed software design that preserve natural working styles.A necessary first step is to identify the unique low-level characteristics of design meetings which must be mimicked in the virtual world. Our work embarks on this path with a detailed ethnographic study of two collocated design meetings. We present several observations and their implications for the design of collaboration tools.", "authors": [{"name": "Uri Dekel", "author_profile_id": "81100230251", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA", "person_id": "P643495", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094947", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094947", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Towards distributed software design meetings: what can we learn from co-located meetings?", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094947"}
