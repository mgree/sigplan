System designers and deployers can use these techniques to configure quality of service (QoS) aspects of their systems and fine-tune their systems during the design and runtime phases to ensure their systems meet end-to-end performance requirements.", "authors": [{"name": "Gan Deng", "author_profile_id": "81100180237", "affiliation": "Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN", "person_id": "P669628", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094909", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094909", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Supporting configuration and deployment of component-based DRE systems using frameworks, models, and aspects", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094909"}
