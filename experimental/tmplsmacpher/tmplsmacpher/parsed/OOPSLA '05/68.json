We call such an approach <b>delta-driven</b>. The platform is intended as a delivery vehicle for semantically integrated software, and thus lends itself to the semantic web, domain-driven development, and next-generation software development environments. Execution is transparent, versioned, and persistent. This technology - still at an early stage - is called domain/object.", "authors": [{"name": "Roly Perera", "author_profile_id": "81100601879", "affiliation": "Dynamic Aspects, Bristol, United Kingdom", "person_id": "P698166", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jeff Foster", "author_profile_id": "81100121170", "affiliation": "Dynamic Aspects, Bristol, United Kingdom", "person_id": "PP24009839", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094935", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094935", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "A delta-driven execution model for semantic computing", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094935"}
