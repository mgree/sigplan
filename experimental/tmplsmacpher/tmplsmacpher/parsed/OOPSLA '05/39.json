In this way both runtime data and program code can be dynamically adapted to the problem at hand (in traditional software only data is designed to change at runtime). The details of the proposed approach and some prototype systems are presented and discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "Mauro Marinilli", "author_profile_id": "81100344354", "affiliation": "University of Roma Tre, Rome", "person_id": "P392057", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094905", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094905", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Self-designing software", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094905"}
