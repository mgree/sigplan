TableCode defines the object in databases, then extends this definition (1) \"vertically\" by relating the object to the application model and the domain model that the object is a part of; and (2) \"horizontally\" by adding more definition and description to the object model (as well as to the application and the domain model) in order to fully define the object and the environment which surrounds it. This will enable a unified approach to apply Aspect-Oriented techniques and allow domain experts to change their software in accordance with their dynamics needs.", "authors": [{"name": "Salleh Diab", "author_profile_id": "81100303267", "affiliation": "TableCode Software Corp., Amherst, NH", "person_id": "P753414", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Yeh Diab", "author_profile_id": "81100303260", "affiliation": "TableCode Software Corp., Amherst, NH", "person_id": "P753430", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094930", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094930", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "TableCode: defining, extending and deploying object-oriented programs directly from databases", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094930"}
