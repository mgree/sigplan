We summarize experiences from two courses introduced in two academic institutions over four semesters -- both from students' and instructors' perspectives. Examples of projects and the discussion of the assignment flows are given. The paper highlights testing as an all-encompassing activity in software development projects. It also contains recommendations for academics thinking of incorporating executable acceptance testing into their courses.", "authors": [{"name": "Grigori Melnik", "author_profile_id": "81100162802", "affiliation": "University of Calgary/SAIT Polytechnic, Calgary, Alberta, Canada", "person_id": "P460031", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Frank Maurer", "author_profile_id": "81100364840", "affiliation": "University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada", "person_id": "PP39039594", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094974", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094974", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "The practice of specifying requirements using executable acceptance tests in computer science courses", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094974"}
