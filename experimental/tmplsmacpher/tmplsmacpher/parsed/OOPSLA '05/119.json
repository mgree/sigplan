That is, each object is aware and in direct control of its behavior in time. Croquet also directly supports replication of computation, allowing computation to be moved close to the point of interaction on demand, while maintaining a consistent view of behaviors that can scale to include thousands of nodes. In the talk, we'll highlight the main concepts of TeaTime, which provides that semantic model, and also talk about some of the interesting implementation issues involved in realizing the TeaTime semantics.", "authors": [{"name": "David P.
