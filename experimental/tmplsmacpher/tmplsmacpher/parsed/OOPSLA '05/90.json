{"article_publication_date": "10-16-2005", "fulltext": "\n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "1094855", "abstract": "It is well documented that software product cost estimates are notoriously inaccurate across the software industry. Creating accurate cost estimates for software product development projects early in the product development lifecycle has always been a challenge for the industry. This article describes how a large multi-team software engineering organization (over 450 engineers) estimates project cost accurately and early in the software development lifecycle using Use Case Points, and the process of evaluating metrics to ensure the accuracy of the model.The engineering teams of Agilis Solutions in partnership with FPT Software, provide our customers with accurate estimates for software product projects early in the product lifecycle. The bases for these estimates are initial definitions of Use Cases, given point factors and modified for technical and environmental factors according to the Use Case Point method defined within the Rational Unified Process. After applying the process across hundreds of sizable (60 man-months average) software projects, we have demonstrated metrics that prove an estimating accuracy of less than 9% deviation from actual to estimated cost on 95% of our projects. Our process and this success factor is documented over a period of five years, and across more than 200 projects.", "authors": [{"name": "Edward R.
