The project has been used to successfully predict performance and safety properties of real-time systems, but the concepts and technology can be applied to predict other properties (e.g., reliability, security).", "authors": [{"name": "Paulo Merson", "author_profile_id": "81332515371", "affiliation": "Software Engineering Institute, Pittsburgh, PA", "person_id": "PP36024922", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Scott Hissam", "author_profile_id": "81100321257", "affiliation": "Software Engineering Institute, Pittsburgh, PA", "person_id": "PP14116786", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094900", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094900", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Predictability by construction", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094900"}
