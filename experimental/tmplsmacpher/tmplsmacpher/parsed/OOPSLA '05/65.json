Developing software for such mobile networks is extremely hard in conventional programming languages because the network is dynamically defined. We demonstrate a new distributed programming language named AmbientTalk, a research vehicle to experiment with expressive high-level language constructs for <i>Ambient-Oriented Programming.</i>", "authors": [{"name": "Jessie Dedecker", "author_profile_id": "81100128864", "affiliation": "Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium", "person_id": "P753371", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094932", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094932", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Ambient-oriented programming in AmbientTalk: combining mobile hardware with simplicity and expressiveness", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094932"}
