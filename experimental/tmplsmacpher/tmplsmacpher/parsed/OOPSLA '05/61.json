The original system [1] was developed with Common Object Request Broker Architecture (Corba) [2] objects to implement the framework interfaces to code-dependent methods. To add new codes to the initial system required the implementation of new Corba interface objects. Globus Grid objects [3] have extended that original system, and have resulted in added flexibility in the design for the addition of new codes. High-performance computing agent services were also implemented as Globus Grid objects, resulting in enhanced communications between the framework user interface services and the agents responsible for executing the codes. The management functions for remote agents have also been improved.", "authors": [{"name": "Scott E.
