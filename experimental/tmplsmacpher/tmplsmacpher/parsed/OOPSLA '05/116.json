He's an author who has struggled with understanding what good design might be and how to communicate it. His books on patterns, refactoring, UML, and agile development reflect this question and his struggles to find an answer. He hasn't succeeded yet, but is happy to share his current position, lost in a maze of twisty objects, all alike.", "authors": [{"name": "Martin Fowler", "author_profile_id": "81100062314", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP14032424", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094858", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094858", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Finding good design", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094858"}
