Based on executable code, a problem is set that is to be solved collaboratively and interactively by all the participants of a teaching unit. A moderator is on hand to operate the computer, the development environment and video projector when called upon to do so. While deployable in themselves as an innovative teaching method, teachlets can also be used as a design object in seminar-like workshop events. In the course on advanced concepts of object-oriented programming described here, the participants themselves developed and used teachlets in a so-called teachlet laboratory.", "authors": [{"name": "Axel Schmolitzky", "author_profile_id": "81100640953", "affiliation": "University of Hamburg - Germany, Hamburg", "person_id": "P445244", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094969", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094969", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "A laboratory for teaching object-oriented language and design concepts with teachlets", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094969"}
