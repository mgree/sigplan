There are problematic aspects of framework development. When frameworks are extended with functionality implemented by other frameworks, developers face a difficult task solving static and (specially) dynamic mismatches. The dynamic aspect is less visible to developers thus it is usually the cause of failure, specially in frameworks using multi threading programming.This paper shows how to verify the soundness of framework compositions at dynamic level using using temporal logic and tools provided by Full Maude.", "authors": [{"name": "Federico Balaguer", "author_profile_id": "81100088829", "affiliation": "University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL", "person_id": "PP31026673", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094894", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094894", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Model checking the behavior of frameworks extended with other frameworks", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094894"}
