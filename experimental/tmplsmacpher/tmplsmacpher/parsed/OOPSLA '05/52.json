{"article_publication_date": "10-16-2005", "fulltext": "\n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "1094855", "abstract": "Designing component-based application that meets performance requirements remains a challenging problem, and usually requires a prototype to be constructed to benchmark performance. Building a custom benchmark suite is however costly and tedious. This demonstration illustrates an approach for generating customized component-based benchmark applications using a Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach. All the platform related plumbing and basic performance testing routines are encapsulated in MDA generation \"cartridges\" along with default implementations of testing logic. We will show how to use a tailored version of the UML 2.0 Testing Profile to model a customized load testing client. The performance configuration (such as transaction mix and spiking simulations) can also be modeled using the UML model. Executing the generated deployable code will collect the performance testing data automatically. The tool implementation is based on a widely used open source MDA framework AndroMDA. We extended it by providing a cartridge for a performance testing tailored version of the UML 2.0 Testing Profile. Essentially, we use OO-based meta-modeling in designing and implementing a lightweight performance testing domain specific language with supporting infrastructure on top of the existing UML testing standard.", "authors": [{"name": "Liming Zhu", "author_profile_id": "81100413984", "affiliation": "University of NSW, Australia", "person_id": "PP39041676", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Yan Liu", "author_profile_id": "81100537631", "affiliation": "National ICT Australia", "person_id": "PP15035561", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ian Gorton", "author_profile_id": "81100371712", "affiliation": "National ICT Australia", "person_id": "PP15030477", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ngoc Bao Bui", "author_profile_id": "81100607358", "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney, Australia", "person_id": "P753393", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094919", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094919", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "MDAbench: a tool for customized benchmark generation using MDA", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094919"}
