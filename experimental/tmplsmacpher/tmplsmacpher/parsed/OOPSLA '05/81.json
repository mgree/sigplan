Hence, sound foundations and mechanisms for the establishment of unanticipated peer-to-peer interactions across organizational boundaries are of significant importance to upcoming middleware platforms. The Executable Choreography Framework (ECF) is a middleware-level framework that targets dynamic and decentralized service compositions. The ECF combines transparent context propagation with aspect-oriented software composition techniques to dynamically refine the default control and data flow of service invocations. The framework provides a ground for experimentation with dynamic and distributed workflows, and a base to assess their safety and applicability when deployed across organizational boundaries.", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas Cottenier", "author_profile_id": "81100123909", "affiliation": "Illinois Institute of Technology", "person_id": "P753423", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Tzilla Elrad", "author_profile_id": "81100137728", "affiliation": "Illinois Institute of Technology", "person_id": "PP14058901", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094950", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094950", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Adaptive compositions across organizational boundaries", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094950"}
