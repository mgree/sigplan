Developing software for such mobile networks is extremely hard in conventional programming languages because the network is dynamically defined. This hardware phenomenon leads us to postulate a suite of characteristics of future <i>Ambient-Oriented Programming</i> languages. A simple re ective programming language kernel, called AmbientTalk, that meets these characteristics is subsequently presented. The power of the re ective kernel is illustrated by using it to conceive a collection of high level tentative ambient-oriented programming language features.", "authors": [{"name": "Jessie Dedecker", "author_profile_id": "81100128864", "affiliation": "Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium", "person_id": "P753371", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Tom Van Cutsem", "author_profile_id": "81100203786", "affiliation": "Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium", "person_id": "P753426", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Stijn Mostinckx", "author_profile_id": "81100611475", "affiliation": "Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium", "person_id": "P753422", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Theo D'Hondt", "author_profile_id": "81100105560", "affiliation": "Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium", "person_id": "PP39027354", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Wolfgang De Meuter", "author_profile_id": "81100363968", "affiliation": "Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium", "person_id": "P753429", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094867", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094867", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Ambient-oriented programming", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094867"}
