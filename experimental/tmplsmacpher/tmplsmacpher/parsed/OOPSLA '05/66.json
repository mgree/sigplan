In this demonstration, we present a tool, Relo that supports users' understanding by allowing interactive exploration of code. As the developer explores relationships found in the code, Relo builds and automatically manages a visualization mirroring the developer's mental model, allowing them to group viewed artifacts or use the viewed items to ask the system for further exploration suggestions.", "authors": [{"name": "Vineet Sinha", "author_profile_id": "81100335707", "affiliation": "MIT, Cambridge, MA", "person_id": "PP43119048", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Rob Miller", "author_profile_id": "81100162232", "affiliation": "MIT, Cambridge, MA", "person_id": "PP14067017", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "David Karger", "author_profile_id": "81100337812", "affiliation": "MIT, Cambridge, MA", "person_id": "PP15029552", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094933", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094933", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Incremental exploratory visualization of relationships in large codebases for program comprehension", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094933"}
