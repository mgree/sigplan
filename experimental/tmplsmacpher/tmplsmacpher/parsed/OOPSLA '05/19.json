To address these problems, this research poster presents a comprehensive approach to model transformation. Within this approach, a high-level aspectual model transformation language is designed to specify tasks of model construction and evolution, and then a model transformation engine is used to execute transformation specifications in an automated manner. Testing and debugging tools at the modeling level are provided to assist in detecting errors in the model transformation.", "authors": [{"name": "Yuehua Lin", "author_profile_id": "81100224379", "affiliation": "University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL", "person_id": "PP14087847", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jeff Gray", "author_profile_id": "81100403059", "affiliation": "University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL", "person_id": "PP15031457", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094885", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094885", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "A comprehensive model transformation approach to automated model construction and evolution", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094885"}
