It has also found early adopters in application development and middleware. This panel discusses the potential expansion and use of AOP into mainstream software development.This question is not just directed to the aspect research community, but also to practicing software development teams and organizations. The panel will explore the appropriate position and awareness of aspect-orientation amidst other advances in software engineering; how to prepare organizations for adoption; and what additional research and development is necessary. The panel discussion will help the OO community to understand the appropriate use of aspect-orientation. It will also highlight areas where additional efforts by AOSD researchers and professionals are required.", "authors": [{"name": "Adrian Colyer", "author_profile_id": "81100049748", "affiliation": "IBM", "person_id": "PP14028705", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jack Greenfield", "author_profile_id": "81100515255", "affiliation": "Microsoft", "person_id": "P643454", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ivar Jacobson", "author_profile_id": "81100030692", "affiliation": "Ivar Jacobson Consulting", "person_id": "P117558", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Gregor Kiczales", "author_profile_id": "81100495415", "affiliation": "University of British Columbia", "person_id": "PP14173163", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Dave Thomas", "author_profile_id": "81100412131", "affiliation": "Bedarra Research Labs", "person_id": "PP43119689", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094977", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094977", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Aspects: passing fad or new foundation?", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094977"}
