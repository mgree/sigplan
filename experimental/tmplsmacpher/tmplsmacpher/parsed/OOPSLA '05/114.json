For Hass, everything is connected. When he works to heighten literacy, he is also working to promote awareness about the environment. Hass believes that natural beauty must be tended to and that caring for a place means knowing it intimately. Poets, especially, need to pay constant attention to the interaction of mind and environment. And when he is talking about poetry itself, whether Matsuo Basho's or Elizabeth Bishop's, Hass is both spontaneous and original, offering poetic insights that cannot be found in any textbook.Robert Hass has published many books of poetry including <i>Field Guide, Praise, Human Wishes,</i> and <i>Sun Under Wood,</i> as well as a book of essays on poetry, Twentieth Century Pleasures. Hass translated many of the works of Nobel Prize-winning Polish poet, Czeslaw Milosz, and he edited <i>Selected Poems</i>: 1954--1986 by Thomas Transtromer, <i>The Essential Haiku: Versions of Basho, Buson,&lt;and Issa,</i> and ,<i> Poet's Choice: Poems for Everyday Life.,</i> Robert Hass's deep commitment to environmental issues led him to found River of Words (ROW), an organization that promotes environmental and arts education in affiliation with the Library of Congress Center for the Book.
