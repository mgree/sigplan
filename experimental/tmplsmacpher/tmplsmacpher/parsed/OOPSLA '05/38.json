We consider the design of MTA as a sequence of design decisions [10]. Many of the design decisions are examples of security patterns. Thus, this paper is another example of how patterns generate architecture [5].", "authors": [{"name": "Munawar Hafiz", "author_profile_id": "81100376625", "affiliation": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL", "person_id": "P753391", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094904", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094904", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Security patterns and evolution of MTA architecture", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094904"}
