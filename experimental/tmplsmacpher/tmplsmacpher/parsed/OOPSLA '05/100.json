Design is essentially about making choices as an initial idea is extended to construct an executable system. The paper first defines the essence of a solution, the plan structure. It then shows how a plan is built from small pieces, and how an abstract plan is translated into code. Many choices are made when translating a plan into an executable OO system; where there is a choice, a design rule is used to make that choice. The model of teaching identifies the variations and choices that arise during the process of design, and shows how an explicit set of design rules can evaluate the choices and make the best decision.", "authors": [{"name": "Robert S.
