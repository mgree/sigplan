A key feature of DSM is the construction of model interpreters that synthesize the domain models into software artifacts. In the presence of new stakeholder requirements, it is possible that a metamodel undergoes numerous changes during periods of evolution (a new instance of the classic schema evolution problem). Consequently, there is a fundamental problem in keeping the model interpreters up to date with metamodel changes. This research abstract outlines the technical challenges in formalizing model interpreter implementation with the intent to facilitate interpreter evolution in terms of metamodel migration.", "authors": [{"name": "Jing Zhang", "author_profile_id": "81100124224", "affiliation": "University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL", "person_id": "PP15023359", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094941", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094941", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Metamodel-driven model interpreter evolution", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094941"}
