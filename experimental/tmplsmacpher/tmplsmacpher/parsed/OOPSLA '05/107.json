The panelists for this event must be agile in the strictest sense of the word. Why? Because they will be asked to take a random position in response to questions from both the moderators and the audience. They must present their arguments in a timed two-minute speech or present a rebuttal of the initial points in the same restricted two-minute interval. The assignment to the position will be made by the moderators. Don't miss this one.", "authors": [{"name": "Linda Rising", "author_profile_id": "81100569557", "affiliation": "Consultant", "person_id": "PP35031478", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Mary Lynn Manns", "author_profile_id": "81100096374", "affiliation": "University of North Carolina at Asheville", "person_id": "P193226", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Kevlin Henney", "author_profile_id": "81100199732", "affiliation": "Consultant, UK", "person_id": "PP24011926", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Angela Martin", "author_profile_id": "81100391536", "affiliation": "Victoria University of Wellington", "person_id": "PP39040730", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Alan O'Callaghan", "author_profile_id": "81100525490", "affiliation": "De Montfort University, UK", "person_id": "P12685", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Rebecca Wirfs-Brock", "author_profile_id": "81100400353", "affiliation": "Wirfs-Brock Associates", "person_id": "PP17001255", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094979", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094979", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "The agile panel", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094979"}
