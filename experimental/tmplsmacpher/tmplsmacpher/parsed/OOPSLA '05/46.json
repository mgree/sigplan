However, the current interpreter is slow. To solve this problem, some virtual machines were developed, but none with adequate performance or functionality. To fill this gap, I have developed a Ruby interpreter called <i>YARV (Yet Another Ruby VM)</i>. YARV is based on a stack machine architecture and features optimizations for high speed execution of Ruby programs. In this poster, I introduce the Ruby programming language, discuss certain characteristics of Ruby from the aspect of a Ruby interpreter implementer, and explain methods of implementation and optimization. Benchmark results are given at the end.", "authors": [{"name": "Koichi Sasada", "author_profile_id": "81392613064", "affiliation": "Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan", "person_id": "P695660", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1094855.1094912", "year": "2005", "article_id": "1094912", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "YARV: yet another RubyVM: innovating the ruby interpreter", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094912"}
