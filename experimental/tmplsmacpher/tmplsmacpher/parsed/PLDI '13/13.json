We explore this question, \nstarting with the roles that programming languages currently do play in building secure systems and roles \nthat they could play. But to focus on language details misses some key opportunities. Progress in programming \nlanguages is an exemplar for a disci\u00adpline s transition from an art to a craft to a science that informs \nen\u00adgineering. Moreover, evidence mounts that the same science base developed within the programming languages \ncommunity is also useful for building a science of security. We will explore the simi\u00adlarities and discuss \nhow a science of security is likely to be differ\u00adent. We characterize properties that one might expect \nfor a science of security, and we discuss the utility and limitations of existing language-based techniques \nin supporting that agenda. To illustrate, we explore some foundational problems in cyber-security: What \ndoes security mean for a system? This is clearly a speci.\u00adcation question, but it has different scope \nthan speci.cations for ordinary programs. Fundamental models studied in the formal methods community \nneed to be revisited.  How can we characterize classes of defense mechanisms and impose useful structure \non that space? Is it in terms of attacks that will be resisted, policies that will be enforced, or orthogo\u00adnality \nand limits to compositionality?  How do we reconcile the two primary metaphors for authoriza\u00adtion: access \ncontrol versus information-.ow control. Are they linked by notions of universality or by interesting \nreduction re\u00adlations?
