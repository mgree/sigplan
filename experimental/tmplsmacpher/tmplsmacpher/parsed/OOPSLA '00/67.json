The project, which started in 1996, aims to encourage the capture \nand dissemination of successful experience of learning and teaching OT from industry and academia. Today, \na significant body of material exists. We welcome contributions from people with experiences to share, \nor whose own practice is reflected in existing material. History The Pedagogical Patterns Project (PPP) \nwas initiated during OOPSLA 95, and made its first public appearance at ECOOP 96 and then through workshops \nat TOOLS USA '96 and OOPSLA 96. Our aim was to capture successful experiences of learning and teaching \nOT, from industry and academia, in a consistent form that facilitated comparison and accessibility. We \nused the label pattern as an indication that we were trying to capture reusable experience that could \nbe shared. We have held sessions at numerous conferences in America and Europe and have collected in \nexcess of 50 potential patterns [1, 2, 3]. The contributions come from a wide selection of people with \nvarying circumstances and backgrounds, and they vary considerably in focus, from curriculum design to \na technique for teaching or learning a specific concept. Initially we did not see this as a problem as \nwe were trying to collect successful reusable experience, and the people attending our workshops encouraged \nus in our efforts and were enthusiastic about the results. However, patterns on their own are not as \npowerful as patterns working together in a pattern language, so, during the last 18 months, we have tried \nto form the patterns into a coherent language. We have found that although it is possible to make certain \nassociations between patterns, and to see how different patterns might work together, it has proved to \nbe very difficult to produce a coherent pattern language from the collection. Where patterns were generated \nby the same person, and have been designed to work together, these form fragments of a coherent language, \nbut they cannot easily be integrated with other patterns.

Copyright ACM 2000 1-58113-307-3/00/10 \n$5.00 The PPP, and the candidate patterns themselves, have proved to be useful, and have helped educators \nto explore and exchange their teaching experiences. The contributions continue to be reviewed and revised, \nand after four years, interest in the project and its aims is growing and not waning. (The results from \nthe project so far can be seen at our web site http://www-lifia.info.unlp.edu.ar/ppp/.) The most recent \nevent was a focus group held at EuroPLoP earlier this year, and a workshop to be held at OOPSLA 2000. \n Evolution of a Pedagogical Pattern At the TOOLS USA 96 conference, participants in the \"Challenges and \nSuccesses in Teaching OT\" workshop created some drafts for pedagogical patterns by first generating a \nseries of challenges, then brainstorming on the solutions to many of these challenges, and finally formatting \na rough draft of pedagogical patterns for some of the challenges. The steps can be summarized as follows: \n1. One of the challenges is expressed: Students experience interference from procedure-oriented concepts \nthey already know. As a result, there is often more interference than reinforcing. 2. Potential solutions \nare brainstormed: The instructor can make comparisons for students. Or, the instructor can attempt to \nmake students think in an object way from the beginning by postponing answers to students inquiries regarding \nhow their present knowledge (e.g. procedure-oriented) compares to OO. Or, the instructor may wish to \nlead students through the design of a system in first a \"traditional\" way and then in an OO way. 3. \nA pedagogical pattern is drafted from one of the three potential solutions: Solution #3 was formatted \ninto the first draft of a pattern, as follows: Students design and implement a project using a traditional \napproach. Instructor lectures on object concepts and suggests how  this project could be repartitioned \ninto objects. Project is redone, by the students, using objects. 4. The final step is to describe this \npattern using the pedagogical pattern format. We have found this to be a fruitful approach to generating \nfirst-cut patterns, which are then refined by the author. Many of our patterns to date are at this stage. \nHowever, a few have been shepherded, refined, discussed in a pattern-writers workshop, and refined again. \nIn this process, often the more general case embedded in the pattern can be identified, and the name \nchanges to more appropriately reflect the content. Furthermore, related patterns are detected which either \nformulate parts of a pattern language or describe the same general case by using different examples. \n Example patterns The patterns themselves are too large to include in such a short abstract, but we include \nthe name and thumbnail for some of the patterns which have been shepherded and refined according to feedback. \nYou are invited to visit our poster or visit our web site for more information. NAME: Round and Deep \nTHUMBNAIL: An experienced student is likely to gain a deep understanding of a complex concept by relating \nit to his or her own experience. But the same experience which results in a deep understanding may also \nlimit it because a round and deep understanding of a complex concept can only be achieved by considering \ndifferent perspectives. NAME: Mission Impossible (a.k.a.Kobayashi Maru) THUMBNAIL: The Mission Impossible \npattern is used to make learners suspicious about their understanding of important Object Technology \nconcepts so that they continually question those concepts and improve their understanding of them. Learners \noccasionally need to be \"shocked\" into deeper thinking about what they are doing in order to appreciate \nsome of the subtleties. This is all the more necessary when such ideas as \"objects model the real world\" \ncan be understood in an entirely naive way which disarms the learner in the face of real problems when \nthey occur. The Mission Impossible pattern achieves this by presenting apparently simple problems which \ncannot in fact be solved by the na\u00efve application of received wisdom. NAME: Spiral THUMBNAIL: Topics \nin a course are divided up into fragments and the fragments introduced in an order that facilitates student \nproblem solving. Many of the fragments introduce a topic, but do not cover it in detail. Just enough \ndetail is given initially so as to form a basic understanding that can be applied to problem solving. \nAdditional cycles contain reinforcing fragments that go into more detail on the topic.  How you can \ntake part We are always looking for more ideas, and people who are able to validate the patterns, i.e. \ncan see their own practice reflected in the patterns we have collected. This is an important aspect of \nany patterns project, and we are currently setting up a wiki wiki site to allow interactive collaboration \nin identifying, refining and validating patterns.
