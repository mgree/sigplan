This \nis of extreme relevance in areas like meteorology and environmental applications. GIS do not have tools \nthat allow the use of this type of information, which often prevents to make a complete analysis. In \nthis work we present an application using object-oriented technology that allows us to manipulate continuous \ndata. Keywords Geographic Information System, applied object oriented technology, continuous data.  \n1. INTRODUCTION Field is an abstract concept used to comprehend several physical phenomena: electromagnetism, \ngravity, electrodynamics and other relativist mechanics. Fields are utilized to understand complex physical \nlaws, which can be expressed in an accurate way by differential equations. A field is a physic space-distributed \namount, which takes a different value on each space point. The set of all possible values taken by the \nfield is called image. The set of space point where phenomena can be measured is named domain. A great \nvariety of applications exists in which the required information are fields; for example any weather \nrelated application must have the capacity to analyze continuous phenomena, like the temperature, the \nhumidity, among others. Surface and pollution are modeled as continuous fields in environmental research. \nDue to the continuous nature of fields it is impossible to store the values corresponding to each space-point \nsince they are infinite. This feature makes hard to handle that information. In this demonstration we \npresent an application that deal with continuous information.

HANDLING CONTINUOUS FIELDS The usual way to manipulate \nthis kind of information is to make a sampling on the data: only some values associated to the phenomenon \nare taken in particular positions; the rest of the needed values are estimated through some estimation \nmethod; this estimation method uses the values of the sample as starting points for the calculation. \nThe sample can be organized in different spatial data models [1][2][5].  Figure 1: Two different SDM \n-TIN and Point Grid- for the same sample In order to know the phenomenon value on non-sampled points \nit is necessary to interpolate using neighbor sampled values. The way used to interpolate is known as \nestimation method. It is possible to use several estimation methods with the same SDM. For instance, \nk nearest-neighbors, b-spline or kriging estimation methods can be used with irregular point grid SDM. \nNowadays, GIS do not provide built-in capabilities to handle continuous fields. Standard GIS are capable \nto represent the values of the sample; but, when it is necessary to make a query referring to a value \nof the function in a position that does not belong to the sample, the needed values are exported to some \nspecific calculus application, then the produced values are imported. Calculus is not a common work place \nfor objects. Along decades, procedural languages have been the chosen tools for developing calculus applications. \nBesides, new GISs have benefit from object orientation. Our motivation was to integrate both calculus \nand GIS, to provide a complete OO model for GIS, and make continuous information available for future \nquery processing. We have extended an existing GIS architecture constructed at LIFIA [4] for handling \ncontinuous fields. Furthermore, we have developed the Tilcara application, using this OO-architecture. \nThis application provides functionality to define, manipulate and query continuous fields. In this demonstration \nwe will show the definition process, it includes sampling, selection of SDM, an estimation method. Then, \nwe will see how to manipulate continuous fields, i.e., change SDM and estimation methods, make complex \noperations among continuous fields [2] -like those used in environmental applications-, and make queries \nabout the result of that manipulation. The objective of this demonstration is to present a real world \nexample of applied object orientation in an uncommon object domain.  3.
