However, many who have tried to introduce patterns (or any new idea) into \ntheir organizations have found it to be a difficult task. Therefore, a pattern language, currently titled \nEvolving a Patterns Culture, is being written to capture solutions to the challenges in introducing patterns \n(or any new idea) into an organization. Patterns and pattern languages are a new contribution to software \nreuse. They have become the tool of a growing community that is attempting to capture best practices \nin the software development industry. Unlike other methods for doing this, patterns offer both a literary \nform and a process for documenting knowledge. As a recent article in the Wall Street Journal points out, \npatterns based on the work of Christopher Alexander [1,2] \"are notable not just for what they say but \nfor how they say it.\"[7] The process includes well-defined methods for shepherding [5], workshopping \n[4] and publishing patterns (e.g. [6]). In recent years, there has been a promising body of empirical \nand anecdotal evidence to suggest their Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of thiswork \nfor personal or classroom use is granted without feeprovided that copies are not made or distributed \nfor profit orcommercial advantage and that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial \nadvantage and thatcopies bear this notice and the citation on the first page.

This has led \nColdewey and Dyson to write, \"Patterns have changed the way we think about building software and have \nchanged the way we work.\"[3] Even though organizations have much to gain from a reuse approach to software \ndevelopment, there is little evidence that many are utilizing patterns to achieve it. This may be due, \nat least in part, to the observation that introducing patterns into an organization comes with many challenges \n(e.g. [8]). The spark for patterns (or any new idea) in an organization most often begins with one or \nmore enlightened individuals who has heard about or used patterns (or another new idea) and is intrigued \nby the potential. It then becomes the task of these individuals to enlighten the rest of the organization. \nIt can be an easier undertaking when you have an understanding of the problems that may be encountered \nalong the way and what can be done to address these problems. Work towards documenting these problems \nand solutions in the form of patterns was begun by David DeLano and Linda Rising of AG Communication \nSystems in Arizona during their Introducing Patterns into the Workplace1 workshop at OOPSLA'96. The patterns \nwere later expanded to Introducing Technology into the Workplace.2 In 1998, Mary Lynn Manns began introducing \npatterns into organizations, and holding \"introducing patterns\" workshops at various conferences. She \ndocumented her observations in the form of patterns, and this collection was workshopped at PLoP'99. \nIn March, at the ChiliPLoP'2000 conference, Rising and Manns worked with others during a 3-day \"hot topic\" \nsession to combine their two collections of patterns into a fledging language currently titled Evolving \na Patterns Culture.3 The present focus of this language is on the introduction of patterns into organizations. \nThe collection includes at this point: Evangelist, Disciples, Local Leader, Corporate Angel, Dedicated \nChampion, and others. The next task will be to add patterns to \"Keep It Going\" where the goal is to evolve \nan organization that is committed to including patterns as part of their software development process. \nAs the collection of patterns grows, it will continue to reflect the close connection between the experiences \nof people from organizations all over the world. During this OOPSLA'2000 workshop, participants will \ndiscuss their experiences introducing patterns (or any new idea or technology) into an organization. \nThis will allow additional patterns to be \"mined,\" and known uses and other improvements to be added \nto the existing patterns. These insights will result in a deeper understanding of this growing language \nand a more useful collection of patterns. References [1] Alexander, C. (1979).
