It imports and views maps with embedded databases. It includes searching, zooming and \nprinting facilities. Documenter runs under all Windows operating systems. The documenter uses ActiveX \ntechnology, as OLE especially the object handler dynamic link library that does not activate the OLE \nserver when the embedded object is used. One of The problems faced while developing the package is the \ninconsistency of maps starting points opened within the OLE container. Another problem was the interrelated \ncoordinates of a map and how to manage the zooming of the maps within the OLE container putting in consideration \nthe activation of the OLE server. The package solves those problems in a simple and creative manner. \nThe GUI design of DOCUMENTER is collaboration between the system users and the developers. The software \nis developed using the IEF methodology. DOCUMENTER uses the OLE technology in a creative manner, which \nhelps in minimizing the maps access time, and eliminates the need of the ole server while running the \nsystem a fact that decreases tremendously the licensing expenses. Figurel gives a general overview of \nthe system.
