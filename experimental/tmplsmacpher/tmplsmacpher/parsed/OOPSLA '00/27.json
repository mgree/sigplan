But \noften object-oriented methods focus only on parts of the development process and describe a smooth transition \nfor only one specific step of the process. They fail to provide a continuous and homogeneous way through \nan entire object-oriented project. 2 THE BASIC IDEA The Tools &#38; Materials approach (see [2]) guides \nthe developer through the entire process. To realize this, it provides an application- and task-oriented \nmethodology for software development. The main idea behind the approach is to realize high use quality \nof software. This involves the following aspects: The functionality of the system is oriented to the \ntasks of the application domain.  Operation of the system is user-friendly.  The process and steps \ndefined in the system can be easily adapted to actual requirements in accordance with the work situation. \n Based on object-oriented design and construction techniques, the T&#38;M approach unifies various components \nsuch as a leitmotif with design metaphors, application\u00adoriented documents and an evolutionary approach \nusing prototyping. Even the implementation is supported by a complete Java-based application framework, \ncalled JWAM (WAM is a German acronym for the Tools &#38; Materials approach). The basic idea behind the \napproach is to achieve a structural similarity between the application domain and the software system. \nThe benefit obtained is a close correspondence Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part \nof this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or \ndistributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation \non the first page.

They help us to analyze the application domain and \nbuild a bridge from the application domain via object-oriented design to the technical implementation \nof the software system. The approach is document-driven. Starting a new development cycle within an evolutionary \nprocess, we use a number of documents to analyze and mainly to understand the application domain. These \ndocuments are critically reviewed and revised in an author/critic cycle. Scenarios (corresponding to \nthe Business Use Cases of the Unified Approach [4]) and glossaries are the documents of choice for describing \nthe current work situation. A system vision (corresponding to Use Cases) then describes the design of \nthe target system in application-oriented terms. These documents are complemented by prototypes. To understand \nand model the cooperative parts of work, we use cooperation diagrams. These are useful for modeling both \nthe current situation and future workflows, including the new application system. 4 DESIGN PATTERNS \nDescribing the application domain using documents based on a common viewpoint and common design metaphors \nis the first step toward an software system. The second step is the design of the target software system \nusing similar documents and the same design metaphors. The T&#38;M approach guides the developer through \nthese application\u00adoriented tasks. The crucial next step is bridging the gap between the design and the \ntechnical construction of the software system. Here, the design metaphors are related to matching design \npatterns (see [3]). The Tools &#38; Materials approach contains a set of appropriate design patterns \nfor each metaphor, providing the developer with detailed instructions for object-oriented construction. \nA tool, for example, is realized by a specialized MVC pattern. 5 THE JWAM FRAMEWORK AS TECHNICAL BASIS \nBuilding interactive application software is a nontrivial task. As the T&#38;M approach is frequently \nused to build workplace systems, we have developed a sound technical basis for this type of system. Building \non experience gained in industrial projects using the approach, we have developed the JWAM framework \n(see [5]). This Java-based framework contains an architectural infrastructure (the layer architecture, \nsee [1]) as well as a number of predefined components and classes. The framework and the components are \nbased on the design patterns of the T&#38;M approach. Using the JWAM framework, a developer can easily \nimplement materials, tools or automata and arrange them into a complete work environment. The framework \nprovides an architecture supporting the integration of legacy systems and allowing a smooth transition \nto new object\u00adoriented applications using modern techniques. The JWAM framework is, then, more than just \na few superclasses for tools and materials. It objectifies a leading-edge, layered software architecture \nfor interactive workplace systems. 6 CONCLUSION The Tools &#38; Materials approach guides the software \ndeveloper through the entire development process using documents, design metaphors, design patterns and \na Java\u00adbased framework. All of these components are based on the idea of application orientation. They \nare built for extensibility and flexibility, and they fit together perfectly. Using the T&#38;M approach \nin both research projects and in a large number of industrial projects, we have a very positive record \nof high-quality software produced on time and within budget. The approach has shown its strength in banking \nprojects, for car-rental software as well as for sales-order management and other domains. During the \npast few years, the framework has evolved from a research project to a commercially usable piece of software. \n 7 REFERENCES 1. D. B\u00e4umer, G. Gryczan, R. Knoll, C. Lilienthal, D.
