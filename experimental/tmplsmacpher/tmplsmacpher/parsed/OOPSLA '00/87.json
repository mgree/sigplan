It was designed to show people \nhow to build large, distributed object systems. The system includes over 94 domain objects. In addition \nto the FoodSmart application, the demo will access design patterns that were developed as part of writing \nthe application. Viewers can see a complete system from design issue documentation to source code plus \nexplanation to the actual application. FoodSmart was based on a 5 tier conceptual framework -presentation, \napplication, services, domain and persistence. The application uses 9 major technologies-Java script, \nHTML, JSP, EJB, JNDI, Persistent Cache Architecture TM,JDBC, and RDBMS. In addition, FoodSmart was designed \nto allow 4 architectural variants with two persistence (object and relational) modes. Supporting FoodSmart \nare multiple design patterns that address key issues in distributed object design such as use of a service-based \narchitecture, short versus long transactions, object state distribution, scaling techniques and object \nto relational mapping. FoodSmart is the first available application that considers these issues in relationship \nto each other, providing developers with code and rules of thumb that will work in a highly scalable \nsystem.
