The Educators' Symposium facilitates the exchange of ideas in a number of ways, including \nfeatured talks by professionals on the cutting edge of OO education, paper presentations, and activity \nsessions. Furthermore the successful poster session has been expanded to an exhibition. This exhibition \nprovides the ideal opportuniD, for exchanging teaching and learning techniques, networking with professionals \nfacing similar challenges, and exploring teaching and learning tools. All attendees are invited to actively \nparticipate in the exhibition by bringing any related material they would like to share. The new millennium \nposes a lot of challenges in education. We are aware of these new challenges and we want to share our \nexperiences and ideas about how we can address them. This year's Educators' Symposium, at the same time \nallows us to reflect on our over all experience and to prepare ourselves for the Nture by looking at \ndifferent research projects in education. One of the problems we are facing is the globalization of the \nworld. This may be a stronger force in Europe where all the different cultures try to form a Union, but \neven outside Europe companies merge together and with them different cultures. Additionally this only \none aspect of inconstancy also other things, e.g. technologies do not persist for a long time anymore \ninstead they change rather thst. It is part of our responsibility to aid people living those changes, \n Key Note: Educating for Change is common kzmwledge that educating doesn't mean to teach technical skills \nonly, it is even more important to foccus on the social part. This means that we have to describe new \nways of teaching that also provide an environment for learning social skills like team or communication \nskills. This topic will mainly be addressed in the Key Note of Kent Beck, First Class Software, In his \ntalk about \"Educating for Change\" he focuses on the importance of teaching collaboration skills, which \nis often underestimated and therefore ousted by teaching technical skills. He analyzes some reasons why \nprojects fail. According to his experience not only didn't school teaching address these issues, it also \ndidn't seem to be aware that they even existed. Academia and Industry cooperation At last year's OOPSLA \npeople from industry, academia as well as students discussed in the Love-Hate-Triangle, which was implemented \nas a special Goldfish Bowl, how the cooperation of Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or \npan of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made \nor distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation \non the first page.

OOPSLA 2000 Comptmion Minneapolis, Minncsola (c) Copyright ACM \n2000 1-58113-307-3/00/10...S5.00 industry and academia can be improved. This year we will hear ~me experience \nreports from difl~rem people who avtacked this problem. This topic will be tit from different angles \n-first an experie~ce report will brief us on how academAa revolved indusw in an international cooperative \nproject. This will be followed by onto,her practitioner report discussing some commor~alities between \nconsultants and educators -they both have to play the role of a mentor. The paper presents some ideas \non how to face the challenges of the mentoring process. Finally this session will be rounded up by a \nexperience repo~ about living in both worlds - in indust~' and academia. New Teaching Approaches Education \nis often regarded as a special environment, but a class room is in the same way a portion of the real \nworld as the work environment is. This is also a challenge for the industry to adopt the paradigm of \nthe lea,~n.ing organization. As Arie de Geus, head of planning for Royal Dutch/Shell says in [ 1] qTne \nability to learn faster than your competitors may be the only sustainable competitive advantage.\" In \nthe session called \"New Teaching Approaches\" we want to discuss how education can help achieving this. \nThe introduction to this session will be provided by an invited talk given by Ken Auer and Nathaniet \nTatbott, both RoteModel Soft'are Inc. about an \"Apprenticeship in a Software Studio: An Old and New Model \nfor Education*', where a software studio model of education is discussed, which is based on the experience \nof a master and his apprentice. Further presentations address a wide range of additional improvements \nin education. Ideas on how to teach in a distant learning environment - which is again a result of the \nglobalization, how a learning environment can profit from Extreme Programming or how specific social \nissues can be addressed in an educational setting are presented.
