This methodology allows for specific design and quality requirements of the target migrant system to be considered during the re-engineering process through an iterative and incremental process. The migration process recovers an object model from the procedural code and incrementally refines it by taking into consideration the design requirements for the migrant system.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Ladan Tahvildari", "author_profile_id": "81100007067", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, N2L 3G1", "person_id": "PP14015382", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Kostas Kontogiannis", "author_profile_id": "81100496122", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, N2L 3G1", "person_id": "PP39045640", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/367845.368064", "year": "2000", "article_id": "368064", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "A workbench for quality based software re-engineering (Doctoral Symposium)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=368064"}
