This non-determinism makes understanding and debugging multithreaded Java applications a difficult and laborious process. DejaVu (Deterministic Java Replay Utility) helps the user in understanding and debugging non-deterministic Java applications by deterministically replaying the execution behavior of a non-deterministic execution. In this demo, we will present a debugger for the Jalape&#241;o Java Virtual Machine that utilizes the replay capability provided by DejaVu. The debugger helps in isolating non-deterministic failure(s) by faithfully reproducing the same execution behavior that led to the observe failure(s). Jalapeno is a JVM being developed at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. The debugger provides the following features: (1) DejaVu deterministically replays Java programs; (2) Remote Reflection supports general debugging functionalities such as setting breakpoints, examining the program state, and detecting deadlocks; and (3) a GUI provides an intuitive and easy to use interface.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Bowen Alpern", "author_profile_id": "81100226760", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P31824", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ton Ngo", "author_profile_id": "81100419190", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP31041442", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jong-Deok Choi", "author_profile_id": "81423596242", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP42052144", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Manu Sridharan", "author_profile_id": "81100641428", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P186999", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/367845.368073", "year": "2000", "article_id": "368073", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "DejaVu: deterministic Java replay debugger for Jalape&#241;o Java virtual machine", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=368073"}
