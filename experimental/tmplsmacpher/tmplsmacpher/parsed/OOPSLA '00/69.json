In this research, a new documenting approach \nis proposed combining existing document styles in a kind of \"minimalist\" framework manual with a special \nemphasis on framework understandability and usability, rather than on describing framework design. Benefits \nand drawbacks are evaluated from frameworks of different domains and complexity. Keywords Software documentation, \nobject-oriented application frameworks, \"minimalist\" manuals 1. PROBLEM This research addresses the problem \nof producing understandable framework documentation in an economical way as a means of increasing framework \nreuse effectiveness. 1.1 The Importance of Framework Documentation Frameworks are widely known as a powerful \ntechnique for reuse [7]. Without appropriate documentation, frameworks are, however, particularly hard \nto understand by first-time users, requiring large learning curves and negating major reuse advantages. \nGood documentation can substantially help on the understanding of a new framework, by guiding users on \nthe customization process, and making explicit their design principles and details. Framework documentation \nusually provides multiple views and encompasses distinct styles of documents, such as: framework overviews, \napplication examples, cookbooks, recipes, patterns and contracts. To fulfill all the audiences and requirements \nof a framework, a lot of documentation must be produced and maintained consistently in an elegant and \neconomic way [1].

In this approach, \nthe reader is offered with the minimal amount of information needed to get the task done. Among other \ncharacteristics, a minimalist manual motivate people to train on real tasks and get-started fast, present \ntopics very briefly in the order that seems best for the reader, support error recognition and recovery, \nand tries to explore readers prior knowledge. Among the experiments reported using these ideas to document \nframeworks are [3] and [6]. 1.4 Research Questions This research focus on the following questions: \nHow can framework documentation be organized and presented in order to improve the understandability \nand usability of frameworks, especially by first-time users?  How economical can be a \"minimalist\" framework \nmanual, both to build and to understand?   2. GOAL Although several approaches to framework documentation \nhave proven to be effective, the best mix of document types, writing techniques and presentation styles, \ndepends strongly on the specific objectives, context and economics of the project at hands. The first \ngoal of this research is the definition of a methodology, encompassing a generic model and process for \nproducing framework documentation in the form of a \"minimalist\" manual, and the definition of a set \nof tools to help automate parts of the documentation process. Th results will enable the development \nof \"minimalist\" manuals for a small set of frameworks specially selected for this work, and the evaluation \nof how economical is to build such manuals. The other equally important goal is to evaluate the impact \nthat \"minimalist\" framework manuals have on the understandability and usability of frameworks. From the \npoint of view of \"minimalist\" manuals [2], the ideas of \"minimalism\" will be leveraged to large and complex \nsoftware systems, and its adequacy will be evaluated for these new situations. From the perspective of \nframework documentation, the main result will be the identification and structuring of all blocks of \ninformation and transformations needed to properly document a framework, with a special emphasis on its \npurpose and use. 3. APPROACH The research will be structured in four major parts: the development of \na documenting methodology;  the application of the methodology on existing frameworks;  the application \nof the methodology on frameworks under development;  the evaluation of the resulting framework documentation. \n Each of these parts is briefly explained and related in the next subsections. 3.1 Methodology Development \nThe first part of this research consists on developing a lightweight methodology for producing framework \ndocumentation in the form of a \"minimalist\" manual. This methodology should be flexible enough so that \nit can be adapted to the specificity of existing framework development processes. 3.1.1 Model Definition \nThe model will enumerate, describe and relate all blocks of information considered important for documenting \na framework in a minimalist way. When instantiating the model to a particular framework development project \nit should be possible to decide to use all or only a part of the blocks identified. 3.1.2 Process Definition \nThe process will define the roles, techniques, and activities needed to produce the intended documentation. \nThis documenting process should be intertwined with the framework development process in order to gather, \ntransform and manage the blocks of information described in the model. The documenting process will be \nbased mostly on the ideas of literate programming [4] [5]. 3.1.3 Tools Identification and Development \nIdeally, the process should be as automated as possible, but definitely there are blocks of information \nthat cannot be automatically produced and, thus, dedicated writers or developers must write them. In \nthis part of the research, tools will be identified to help automate the documenting process, and developed \nwhenever possible.  3.2 Documentation of Existing Frameworks To evaluate and fine-tune the methodology, \ntwo small existing object-oriented frameworks will be documented: FormManager, for the construction of \nuser interface forms; RecordManager, for the retrieving and management of records from relational database \ntables, in an object-oriented application. 3.3 Documentation of Frameworks Under Development After having \nsuccessfully applied the methodology and tools for the two small frameworks, the approach will be then \napplied to one framework under development, to evaluate the adequacy of the approach in a typical development \nenvironment. 3.4 Evaluation To evaluate if the \"minimalist\" framework manuals produced are better than \ntraditional documentation, an empirical study will be conducted on two groups of academic students that \nwill serve as first-users of the framework.  4. SUMMARY Frameworks are a powerful technique for reuse \nwhose success depends strongly on the quality of the accompanying documentation. Framework documentation \nhelps users to understand their purpose, to learn how to customize it and to know its design details. \nA lot of work already exists on ways of documenting the design and architecture of frameworks. In this \nresearch, it is proposed an approach to produce, in an effective way, framework documentation with a \nstrong emphasis on describing its purpose and intended use. Following the theory of minimalist manuals, \nthe goals of the research are, first, the definition of a methodology (model, process and tools) to economically \nproduce minimalist framework manuals; and, second, the evaluation of the methodology on frameworks of \ndifferent domains and complexity. 5.
