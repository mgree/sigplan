The Whitbread yacht race \nconsists of 9 legs which, when completed, circumnavigate the globe. Quokka, in addition to offering live \nGPS visualization of the status of the race, wanted to allow the audience to virtually sail along with \nthe actual competing syndicates. Quokka collected GPS telemetry from the Whitbread boats and stored these \nin a relational database. These geographic positions would then be overlaid on map images that were generated \nby chart servers and served on the web. These chart servers were designed to render a nautical chart \nimage based on a pair on geographic coordinates describing the upper left and lower right coordinates \nof the desired chart. It was envisioned that if one could predict the performance of a boat, based on \nfactors such as hull design and wind direction and speed, then one could manufacture a series of geographic \ncoordinates that would describe a boat s progress. This is the idea behind our virtual race: ? Allow \nspectators to register to enter and select a hull design and set of sails to use as each leg of the race \nunfolds.

Visualize, on the web, the current position of each virtual boat and the predicted and current weather, \nwhich included wind speed and direction. ? Enable each virtual sailor to plot a course by laying waypoints \nupon a nautical chart. These are points to which the virtual boat is to be steered. ? Apply these sailing \ndecisions and advance the position of each boat. ? Entice the audience to repeatedly visit the site and \nadjust their sailing decisions based on the changing weather. By displaying the virtual fleet alongside \nthe actual fleet, the audience would virtually compete against the Whitbread sailors. The application \nconsisted of the interaction between several components, including: Nautical Chart Server It was important \nto Quokka that the reportage of the actual race and the user interface of the virtual race include nautical \ncharts that the audience could manipulate, meaning zooming and panning capabilities. To fulfill this \nneed, and acquire charts that displayed the proper nautical features, we contracted with Euronav, a software \nvendor specializing in charting technology in use by sailors around the world. The software renders images \nbased on vector data created by Euronav and included with its products. We placed a web interface on \ntop of their software. This interface would return a jpeg image in response to an http request. The request \nwould describe the desired chart, specifying the coordinates of the upper left and lower right corners. \nThe Game Engine Performance prediction and simulation is the job of Naval Architects. They develop mathematical \nmodels resulting in boat polars. These are used to predict the performance of the boat depending on wind. \nWe contracted with such an architect to provide us with a collection of C++ classes that could be used \ncalculate the progress of a virtual boat. As input the game engine accepted the following: ? Hull design \n? Wind fields a collection of wind speed and directions covering the area around the boat ? Current \nboat position ? Current sail fatigue factor ? Sailing time duration Weather Reporting Quokka contracted \nwith UK Met to provide us with weather reports. These reports consisted of wind speed and direction. \nThe coverage was worldwide with each data point at about 1-degree intervals. Visualization and the UI \nOne of the key challenges was to create a user interface that was both intuitive (for non-sailors) and \nprovided enough sailing action to appeal to the sailing audience. This was achieved through the use of \njava applets. Two applets were provided: A race viewer that would allow each user to see the position \nof his boat, and those of his competitors. The second applet provided the active sailing capability. \nActive Sailing consisted of plotting waypoints. These points described the course that the user wanted \nto sail. Users would make strategic decisions based mostly on the weather and their knowledge of the \nprevailing conditions. As the boat positions were updated, through batch processing, users would return \nto the site and alter their sailing decisions based on their performance. The Development Experience \nand Race The project was started in March/1997 and was to be completed for the start of the Whitbread \nin Sept/1997. This meant six months development for something that we had never seen on the web before. \nWe were late. The virtual race launched about 1.5 weeks into the first leg. We positioned the virtual \nfleet at the then current position of the actual fleet. We all were thrilled when we opened the front \ndoor and watched the server activity. The duration of the race was nine months ending in May 1998. The \nlegs averaged about two weeks in duration, with about two week s time off for the yacht crews in between. \nConclusions Although only a game, this application development effort proved to be most challenging. \nWe never did get the kind of performance that we wanted but we did entertain up to 10,000 virtual sailors \nand averaged about 300,00 hits per day during the race. This report will touch on how we responded to \nthis challenge. Topics will include key design elements, the search for reuse, architecture in a distributed \nenvironment, and the effects of rapid prototyping within a small team. Attendees will get a taste of \nhow object technology was utilized to create the virtual race experience.
