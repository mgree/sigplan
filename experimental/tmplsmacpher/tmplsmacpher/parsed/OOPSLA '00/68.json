We present the results from an Educators Symposium session: As OT becomes \nincreasingly submerged beneath delivery technologies (like components), it s ever more important that \neducators are clear about the object principles that provide the benefits we claim. Will we be able to \nrecognize the important principles in the diverse technologies? This Poster will present the results \nof an Activity Session, which is part of the Educators Symposium. In this session the participants of \nthe Educators Symposium will actively discuss the topic of this poster. This poster then presents the \nagreed positions and statements. As object technology becomes increasingly submerged beneath delivery \ntechnologies (such as components) that exploit its potential, it is ever more important that educators \nare clear about the underlying object principles that provide the benefits we claim. This session attempts \nto answer the question: What is OO really all about? Can you write down and explain the key principles \nthat make the object-oriented approach so important and powerful? It s surprisingly difficult to do this. \nWorse still, the concepts we think are \"essential\" to OO seem to change over time. For example, a few \nyears ago the concept of class inheritance was thought to be essential. Now we see that class inheritance \nis an implementation code-sharing trick, and even interface inheritance is but one way - out of many \n- of describing conformance to contracts. Will we be able to recognize the important principles in the \ndiverse technologies that claim to be \"object-oriented?\" And if we can t, how can we expect our students \nto do so? The session will be highly interactive, in the \"think tank\" style. Working in small groups, \nparticipants will determine an agreed position. Groups will then merge to build (hopefully) a consensus. \nThe session will result in a number of position statements that will be collected and published.
