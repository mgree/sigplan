IBM Corp. 2929 North \nCentral Avenue Phoenix, AZ 85012 602-217-2456 traher@us.ibm.com Abstract This presentation illustrates \na software and hardware solution that provides a speedy but reliable and secure delivery of patient clinical \ntrial data to a research data center. A wireless data entry terminal captures patient data and performs \ndata cleaning during data entry. The data is later uploaded to a remote database via a wireless service \ngateway that is connected to the Internet over a high-speed broadband connection. This data is available \nimmediately after being uploaded to the clinical database. The significant reduction in data delivery \ncycle time provides a considerable reduction in trial costs and faster time to market for the new procedure \nor device. 1 Introduction A clinical trial is a designed investigation on the effects of a new drug, \na new medical treatment or a new device on a group of patients. The customer (Medtronic) wanted faster \nturnaround of clinical trial data processing that could provide quicker introduction of new procedures \nor devices and would lower the costs for the trial. The prior method of delivering clinical data used \nhardcopy material that had to be shipped to the trial center and back to the research center. The older \nmethod could not prevent inaccurate data and data omissions from occurring and the delivery method also \nadded to extending the trial period. This meant a longer trial period and higher costs. The client envisioned \na system that would speedup the data entry process, eliminate data entry errors by providing verification \nand validation of data as it was entered, provide faster access to patient data, and shorten the trial \nduration. Patient telemetry data had to also be electronically transmitted. The system had to be compliant \nwith FDA rules on electronic records and electronic signatures.

Additional paper forms were generated during the monthly visits to the \nclinic. Telemetry data collected during each visit was stored on removable storage media. This telemetry \ndata was also mailed to the research center where the data was transferred to the clinical database. \nAt the conclusion of the trial the findings were submitted to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for \napproval of the new procedure or device. All data except the telemetry data was collected by a technician \nand recorded on a paper form. The clinical trial doctor would record some information and review the \ninformation the technician recorded. All forms and removable media were mailed to the research center. \nThe research center would then enter the form data into a clinical database, which was later verified \nby a different individual to insure its accuracy. More errors were detected by running a program that \nwould scan the database for omissions and obvious data entry errors. An experienced clinical trial technician \nwould also scan the data for errors. This cycle would be repeated for every visit the patient made during \nthe clinical trial period. This period could extend from six months to a year with monthly visits. Once \nthe trial period ended it took an additional 1 or 2 months to correlate the data and complete the trial \nfindings. These findings were then submitted to the FDA for approval. 3 New Web Base Process A new web \nbased process was developed that included new software and hardware. The new system collects patient \npersonal data via a user data entry terminal that is a thin client. The data is cleaned during data entry \nand transmitted to the clinical database immediately via a gateway that is connected to the Internet. \nPatient telemetry data is collected on a stand-alone device and then transferred to the data entry terminal \nwhere it is electronically transmitted to the clinical database. Upon arrival at the clinical database \nthe telemetry data is added to the patient s electronic file. Since the data has been cleaned during \nthe entire process the findings can be submitted to the FDA at the conclusion of the trial. 4 Process \nImprovements Benefits The major benefit of this new system is the significant cycle time reduction, which \nmeans the overall cost of the trial is also considerably reduced. This reduction occurs at several points \nin the process including the data collection, data delivery, data storage and submittal of the findings \nto the FDA. The data verification period that previously took several iterations is reduced considerably \nby data verification occurring during data entry. There still is some small verification that is done \nonce the data is transmitted to the clinical database. Data delivery is instantaneous because of the \ncontinuous connection to the Internet. Storage costs have been reduced since the paper forms are no longer \nused. And once all the trial data has been collected the findings can be submitted almost immediately \nto the FDA for approval.  5 Architecture Overview This architecture is a multi-level, distributed client/server \nsolution using unique hardware and software to provide a connection to the Internet using a service gateway. \nA thin client terminal is used for data entry, uploading of patient transponder data, and Internet browsing. \nThe gateway executes an Open System Gateway Initiative (OSGi) compliant software stack that provides \nwireless connection to the Internet, transmission of patient data, telemetry collected from the patient \nmonitoring device and eventually system management services for remote patient\u00admonitoring devices. The \nwireless data transport of patient data allows for mobility of the client terminal. The InForm software \nproduct by PhaseForward executes on a thin client terminal and provides clinical trial software for data \ncollection, automatic edit checking on data entry, secure verification, sophisticated querying, auditing \nand forms management, electronic signature, and full on-line documentation.
