This is not due to a weakness in \nthe Beans property model, but rather to limitations in how Java Beans user interfaces are currently implemented. \nVerdantium is a prototype Java-based API (for JDK 1.2.2 and above) for document embedding that takes \na novel approach to implementing software components. This environment retains the property-based semantics \nfrom Java Beans, but implements different approaches for on-screen presentation, visual embedding, document \nprinting, and persistence. Fully functional applications (i.e., word processors, illustration programs, \nequation editors, etc.) can be implemented as individual software components that can either run independently \nor be embedded in other applications using the same API. Verdantium s presentation API works on top of \nJava JFC/Swing and is implemented using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) philosophy. That is to say, the \nuser interface for a certain kind of document is kept separate from its application logic. The VerdantiumComponent \nis a Java interface implemented by the model class, with the GUI stored in a separate object (though \none may optionally integrate the two). By contrast, Java Beans that are displayed in the Bean Box are \nsubclasses of a view class, with no inherent support given to the underlying model. One important aspect \nof using this interface is that an implementation of VerdantiumComponent does not need to subclass a \ndescendent of java.awt.Component. For instance if the component s GUI is a scrolling pane, one does \nnot have to Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom \nuse is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial \nadvantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Instead, the user interface of the VerdantiumComponent is the Swing JComponent \nreturned by the VerdantiumComponent s getGUI() method. Because Verdantium components do not need to subclass \njava.awt.Component, subclassing can be used instead to enhance design and code reuse. For instance, a \nscrolling component can be implemented as a straightforward subclass of a simpler drawing component that \nrenders onto a pane. The subclass overrides the getGUI() method so that it returns a JScrollPane containing \nthe user interface of the superclass VerdantiumComponent. That is to say, the subclass wraps a JScrollPane \naround what the superclass originally returned from its own getGUI() method. Note that the JScrollPane \nreturned by the subclass and the rendering pane returned by the superclass are two objects that can come \nfrom completely different class hierarchies (as long as they both have JComponent as a common root). \nIn order to provide appropriate support for embedded documents and take full advantage of JFC/Swing functionality, \nVerdantium uses an embedding implementation based on subclassing Swing s existing JDesktopPane and JInternalFrame. \nThe subclass of JInternalFrame modifies the internal frame s MDI user interface so that it displays itself \nin a fashion more consistent with an embedding frame in a typical container application. This provides \na flexible and robust means for moving and resizing embedded components. Unlike typical MDI windows, \nVerdantium embedding frames have a transparent content area, allowing multiple components with transparent \nbackgrounds to overlay each other in a container application. Verdantium also uses a different semantics, \ncompared to most other document frameworks, for the display of embedding frames. Instead of displaying \nframes on a per-component basis, Verdantium uses a global mode that turns them all on, or turns them \nall off. Currently, the primary printing functionality for visual Java Beans is through the use of the \njava.awt.Component print() method, which does not support printing on multiple pages. Verdantium retains \nthe use of this method, but adds an additional API for multi-page printing using the java.awt.print.Printable \ninterface. This allows a multi-page component such as a text editor to be printed by another component \nin a standard way. Verdantium also provides the option for a component to take greater control over the \nprinting process, allowing the component to do things such as display customized print dialogs. A component \nrunning as a standalone application often needs to be printed in a different manner from one than has \nbeen visually embedded in some other component. Verdantium addresses this by allowing a component to \nboth implement the multi-page printing interface and have its UI support the java.awt.Component print() \nmethod. For instance, a visually embedded component might be printed by its parent using the print() \nmethod. Meanwhile, a standalone component displaying the same content might print itself on multiple \npages. Typical pre-Java document applications can load or save data of more than one flavor from persistent \nstorage. For instance, Microsoft Word can save its data to either plain text, RTF, or to its own Microsoft \nWord format. Java Beans persistence APIs currently provide no means for a bean to load and/or save its \nstate in multiple flavors. To compensate for this, the ability to load or save in multiple data flavors \nis provided as a standard part of a VerdantiumComponent. Such a data flavor can either refer to an object \nin a serialized object stream or to a set of raw stream data in a legacy format. This allows a Verdantium \ncomponent to load data formats such as plain text that are currently outside the Java Beans persistence \nmodel. In order to determine which component can load a particular legacy format, the file s extension \nis mapped to a MIME type, and then the mapped MIME type is compared with the MIME types each component \nsupports to determine which one(s) can handle the load request. In addition to legacy file formats, Verdantium \nalso provides a mechanism for a component to save itself to a property list of serializable objects (where \neach such object can be externalized in terms of another property list of objects). This allows an object \nto serialize itself by writing a series of name-value pairs (more precisely name-object pairs), while \nretaining the ability to utilize Java s existing serialization. In addition, the use of property names \nis advantageous when attempting to maintain different versions of the same persistence format over time. \nA single reader can scan for property names from several formats, and maintain compatibility with each. \n \n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "367845", "abstract": "<p>Java Beans provides a robust mechanism for combining software components.
