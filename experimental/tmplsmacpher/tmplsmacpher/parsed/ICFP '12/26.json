Continuing a line of work by Honda (1993), by Honda, Kubo, and Vasconcelos (1998), and by Gay and Vasconcelos (2010), among others, this paper presents GV, a linear functional language with session types, and presents a translation from GV into CP. The translation formalises for the first time a connection between a standard presentation of session types and linear logic, and shows how a modification to the standard presentation yield a language free from deadlock, where deadlock freedom follows from the correspondence to linear logic.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Philip Wadler", "author_profile_id": "81100173596", "affiliation": "University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "person_id": "P3804368", "email_address": "wadler@inf.ed.ac.uk", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/2364527.2364568", "year": "2012", "article_id": "2364568", "conference": "ICFP", "title": "Propositions as sessions", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2364568"}
