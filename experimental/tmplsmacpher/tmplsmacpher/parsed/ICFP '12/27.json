In the context of programming languages based on parametric polymorphism and uniform data representation, we propose a relation of compatibility between (unmarshalled) memory graphs and types. It is defined as constraints over nodes of the memory graph. Then, we propose an algorithm to check the compatibility between a memory graph and a type. It is described as a constraint solver based on a rewriting system. We have shown that the proposed algorithm is sound and semi-complete in presence of algebraic data types, mutable data, polymorphic sharing, cycles, and functional values, however, in its general form, it may not terminate. We have implemented a prototype tailored for the OCaml compiler [17] that always terminates and still seems sufficiently complete in practice.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Gr&#233;goire Henry", "author_profile_id": "81548018673", "affiliation": "Univ Paris Diderot - Sorbonne Paris Cit&#233;, Paris, France", "person_id": "P3804369", "email_address": "gregoire.henry@pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Michel Mauny", "author_profile_id": "81410593751", "affiliation": "ENSTA-Paristech, Paris, France", "person_id": "P3804370", "email_address": "michel.mauny@ensta.fr", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Emmanuel Chailloux", "author_profile_id": "81100622511", "affiliation": "Universit&#233; Pierre et Marie Curie &#38; Sorbonne Universit&#233;s, Paris, France", "person_id": "P3804371", "email_address": "emmanuel.chailloux@lip6.fr", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Pascal Manoury", "author_profile_id": "81548018674", "affiliation": "Universit&#233; Pierre et Marie Curie &#38; Sorbonne Universit&#233;s, Paris, France", "person_id": "P3804372", "email_address": "pascal.manoury@pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/2364527.2364569", "year": "2012", "article_id": "2364569", "conference": "ICFP", "title": "Typing unmarshalling without marshalling types", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2364569"}
