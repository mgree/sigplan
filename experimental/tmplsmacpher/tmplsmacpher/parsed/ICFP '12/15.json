For equational specifications there are several natural notions of equality: equality in all models, equality of the sets of solutions, and equality of normal forms for productive specifications. For &#955;-terms we investigate B&#246;hm-tree equality and various notions of observational equality. We pinpoint the complexity of each of these notions in the arithmetical or analytical hierarchy.</p> <p>We show that the complexity of deciding equality in all models subsumes the entire analytical hierarchy. This holds already for the most simple infinite objects, viz. streams over {0,1}, and stands in sharp contrast to the low arithmetical &#982;<sup>0</sup><sub>2</sub>-completeness of equality of equationally specified streams derived in [17] employing a different notion of equality.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "J&#246;rg Endrullis", "author_profile_id": "81384597261", "affiliation": "VU University Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands", "person_id": "P3804324", "email_address": "j.endrullis@vu.nl", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Dimitri Hendriks", "author_profile_id": "81100188648", "affiliation": "VU University Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands", "person_id": "P3804325", "email_address": "r.d.a.hendriks@vu.nl", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Rena Bakhshi", "author_profile_id": "81414602570", "affiliation": "VU University Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands", "person_id": "P3804326", "email_address": "r.r.bakhshi@vu.nl", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/2364527.2364551", "year": "2012", "article_id": "2364551", "conference": "ICFP", "title": "On the complexity of equivalence of specifications of infinite objects", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2364551"}
