Jar files are typically about 1/2 the size of the original class files due to compression. I have developed a wire-code format for collections of Java class files. This format is typically 1/2 to 1/5 of the size of the corresponding compressed jar file (1/4 to 1/10 the size of the original class files).", "authors": [{"name": "William Pugh", "author_profile_id": "81100057068", "affiliation": "Dept. of Computer Science, Univ. of Maryland, College Park", "person_id": "PP15020758", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/301618.301676", "year": "1999", "article_id": "301676", "conference": "PLDI", "title": "Compressing Java class files", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=301676"}
