The algorithm is a real-time shared-memory copying collector. We prove that the algorithm requires at most 2(<i>R</i>(l + 2/<i>k</i>) + <i>N</i> + 5<i>PD</i>) memory locations, where <i>P</i> is the number of processors, <i>R</i> is the maximum reachable space during a computation (number of locations accessible from the root set), <i>N</i> is the maximum number of reachable objects, <i>D</i> is the maximum depth of any data object, and <i>k</i> is a parameter specifying how many locations are copied each time a location is allocated. Furthermore we show that client threads are never stopped for more than time proportional to <i>k</i> non-blocking machine instructions. The bounds are guaranteed even with arbitrary length arrays. The collector only requires write-barriers (reads are unaffected by the collector), makes few assumptions about the threads that are generating the garbage, and allows them to run mostly asynchronously.", "authors": [{"name": "Guy E.
