Incremental partial evaluation exploit these stages for optimization: it allows further specialization to be performed as data become available at later stages. The fundamental advantage of incremental specialization is to factorize the specialization process. As a result, specializing a program at a given stage costs considerably less than specializing it once all the data are available.We present a realistic and flexible approach to achieve efficient incremental run-time specialization. Rather than developing specific techniques, as previously proposed, we are able to re-use existing technology by iterating a specialization process. Moreover, in doing so, we do not lose any specialization opportunities. This approach makes it possible to exploit nested quasi-invariants and to speed up the run-time specialization process.This approach has been implemented in Tempo, a specializer for C programs that is publicly available. A preliminary experiment confirm that incremental that incremental specialization can greatly speed up the specialization process.", "authors": [{"name": "Renaud Marlet", "author_profile_id": "81100039361", "affiliation": "IRISA/INRIA, Universit&#233; de Rennes 1, Compose project, Campus universitaire de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes cedex, France", "person_id": "P240807", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Charles Consel", "author_profile_id": "81100552270", "affiliation": "IRISA/INRIA, Universit&#233; de Rennes 1, Compose project, Campus universitaire de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes cedex, France", "person_id": "PP39048247", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Philippe Boinot", "author_profile_id": "81100459434", "affiliation": "IRISA/INRIA, Universit&#233; de Rennes 1, Compose project, Campus universitaire de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes cedex, France", "person_id": "P226633", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/301618.301681", "year": "1999", "article_id": "301681", "conference": "PLDI", "title": "Efficient incremental run-time specialization for free", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=301681"}
