Current compiler algorithms for tiling are limited to loops which are perfectly nested or can be transformed, in trivial ways, into a perfect nest. This paper presents a number of program transformations to enable tiling for a class of nontrivial imperfectly-nested loops such that cache locality is improved. We define a program model for such loops and develop compiler algorithms for their tiling. We propose to adopt <i>odd-even variable duplication</i> to break anti- and output dependences without unduly increasing the working-set size, and to adopt <i>speculative execution</i> to enable tiling of loops which may terminate prematurely due to, e.g. convergence tests in iterative algorithms. We have implemented these techniques in a research compiler, Panorama. Initial experiments with several benchmark programs are performed on SGI workstations based on MIPS R5K and R10K processors. Overall, the transformed programs run faster by 9% to 164%.", "authors": [{"name": "Yonghong Song", "author_profile_id": "81100579480", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN", "person_id": "PP39079332", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Zhiyuan Li", "author_profile_id": "81409597718", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN", "person_id": "PP39044657", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/301618.301668", "year": "1999", "article_id": "301668", "conference": "PLDI", "title": "New tiling techniques to improve cache temporal locality", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=301668"}
