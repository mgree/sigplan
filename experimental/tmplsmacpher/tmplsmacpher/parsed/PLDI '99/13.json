{"article_publication_date": "05-01-1999", "fulltext": "\n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "301618", "abstract": "The challenge of exploiting high degrees of instruction-level parallelism is often hampered by frequent branching. Both exposed branch latency and low branch throughput can restrict parallelism. <i>Control critical path reduction</i> (control CPR) is a compilation technique to address these problems. Control CPR can reduce the dependence height of critical paths through branch operations as well as decrease the number of executed branches. In this paper, we present an approach to control CPR that recognizes sequences of branches using profiling statistics. The control CPR transformation is applied to the predominant path through this sequence. Our approach, its implementation, and experimental results are presented. This work demonstrates that control CPR enhances instruction-level parallelism for a variety of application programs and improves their performance across a range of processors.", "authors": [{"name": "Michael Schlansker", "author_profile_id": "81100380823", "affiliation": "Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA", "person_id": "PP14134736", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Scott Mahlke", "author_profile_id": "81100622742", "affiliation": "Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA", "person_id": "P260983", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Richard Johnson", "author_profile_id": "81541797556", "affiliation": "Transmeta Corporation, Santa Clara, CA", "person_id": "PP31081430", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/301618.301659", "year": "1999", "article_id": "301659", "conference": "PLDI", "title": "Control CPR: a branch height reduction optimization for EPIC architectures", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=301659"}
