A program accepts a large training set of program material in a conventional compiler intermediate representation (IR) and automatically infers a decision tree that separates IR code into streams that compress much better than the undifferentiated whole. Driving a conventional arithmetic compressor with this model yields code 30% smaller than the previous record for IR code compression, and 24% smaller than an ambitious optimizing compiler feeding an ambitious general-purpose data compressor.", "authors": [{"name": "Christopher W.
