To overcome this limitation, we developed DyC, a selective dynamic compilation system that includes more sophisticated and flexible analyses and transformations. DyC is able to achieve good performance improvements on programs that are much larger and more complex than the kernels. We analyze the individual optimizations of DyC and assess their impact on performance collectively and individually.", "authors": [{"name": "Brian Grant", "author_profile_id": "81100081531", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Box 352350, Seattle, WA", "person_id": "PP39026295", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Matthai Philipose", "author_profile_id": "81100041707", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Box 352350, Seattle, WA", "person_id": "PP14026343", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Markus Mock", "author_profile_id": "81100376222", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Box 352350, Seattle, WA", "person_id": "PP39076078", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Craig Chambers", "author_profile_id": "81100528252", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Box 352350, Seattle, WA", "person_id": "PP39047060", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Susan J.
