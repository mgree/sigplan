Unlike other path profiling techniques, which record intraprocedural or acyclic paths, WPPs produce a single, compact description of a program's entire control flow, including loop iteration and interprocedural paths.This paper explains how to collect and represent WPPs. It also shows how to use WPPs to find <i>hot subpaths</i>, which are the heavily executed sequences of code that should be the focus of performance tuning and compiler optimization.", "authors": [{"name": "James R.
