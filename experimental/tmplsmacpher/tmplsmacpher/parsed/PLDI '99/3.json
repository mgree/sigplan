In fact, classes in these languages incorporate many of the features found in richer module mechanisms. In this paper, we describe an alternative approach to designing a language that has both classes and modules. In our design, we rely on a rich ML-style module system to provide features such as visibility control and parameterization, while providing a minimal class mechanism that includes only those features needed to support inheritance. Programmers can then use the combination of modules and classes to implement the full range of class-based features and idioms. Our approach has the advantage that it provides a full-featured module system (useful in its own right), while keeping the class mechanism quite simple.We have incorporated this design in MOBY, which is an ML-style language that supports class-based object-oriented programming. In this paper, we describe our design via a series of simple examples, show how various class-based features and idioms are realized in MOBY, compare our design with others, and sketch its formal semantics.", "authors": [{"name": "Kathleen Fisher", "author_profile_id": "81331492634", "affiliation": "AT&T Labs, Research", "person_id": "PP39066733", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "John Reppy", "author_profile_id": "81100590527", "affiliation": "Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies", "person_id": "PP17010305", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/301618.301638", "year": "1999", "article_id": "301638", "conference": "PLDI", "title": "The design of a class mechanism for Moby", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=301638"}
