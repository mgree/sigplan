JavaScript was conceived of as an object-based scripting language , but its inspiration \ncame originally from Scheme, with an admixture of Self. Designing a language to fit the constraints of \nthe target audience of HTML authors, the embedding browser application, and the market conditions of \nthat time was challenging. We discuss what worked and what did not, and how the language evolved due \nto competition and de jure standardization. The talk ranges widely over the history of the web, including \nthe recent renaissance of JavaScript and its development in the ECMA standards group. We close by presenting \nnew work likely to appear in the next version of the language. Bio The speaker is Chief Technical Officer \nof the Mozilla Corporation and a founding member of the Mozilla project. He received an M.S. of Computer \nScience from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Eich created JavaScript at Netscape in 1995, \nhelped standardize the language with ECMA and ISO in 1997, and co-founded mozilla.org in 1998. Before \nNetscape, he worked for MicroUnity and Silicon Graphics on operating systems and networking protocols. \nEich s technical interests include programming language design and implementation, garbage collection, \nvirtual machines, and secure information flow models.
