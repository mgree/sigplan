In this work, we extend the notion of incremental compilation to include optimized code. Techniques to incrementally compile locally optimized code, given intermediate code modifications are developed using a program representation based on flow graphs and dags. A model is designed to represent both unoptimized and optimized code and to maintain an optimizing history. Changes to the optimized code which either destroy optimizations or create conditions for further optimizations are incorporated into the model and the optimized code without recompiling unaffected optimizations.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Lori L.
