The model, an extension of the trace model, can describe both synchronous and asynchronous networks. The proof system uses temporal-logic assertions on sequences of observations &#8212; a generalization of traces. The use of observations (traces) makes the proof system simple, compositional and modular, since internal details can be hidden. The expressive power of temporal logic makes it possible to prove temporal properties (safety, liveness, precedence, etc.) in the system. The proof system is language-independent and works for both synchronous and asynchronous networks.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Van Nguyen", "author_profile_id": "81100511531", "affiliation": "Computer Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY", "person_id": "PP43120743", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "David Gries", "author_profile_id": "81407593474", "affiliation": "Computer Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY", "person_id": "PP40023286", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Susan Owicki", "author_profile_id": "81100374618", "affiliation": "Computer Systems Lab., Stanford University, Stanford, CA", "person_id": "PP39039997", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/318593.318624", "year": "1985", "article_id": "318624", "conference": "POPL", "title": "A model and temporal proof system for networks of processes", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=318624"}
