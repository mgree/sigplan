This paper presents a set of techniques for analyzing aliasing patterns. The analysis is divided into detecting the introduction of aliases and tracking their propagation. The algorithm for introduction analysis is simple enough to be performed in a structured editor or parser. A data flow analysis framework is given for the propagation problem, making it possible to solve using standard algorithms from global data flow analysis. Several optimizations are shown which can shrink the size of the problem, and extensions are given to handle ALGOL-style name scoping. Finally, this technique is compared to an alternative implementation strategy and an approximate technique.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Keith D.
