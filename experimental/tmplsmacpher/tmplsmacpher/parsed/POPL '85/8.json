The running time of the algorithm is exponential in the size of the formula but linear in the size of the checked program. The algorithm yields also a formal proof in case the formula is valid over the program. The algorithm has four versions that check satisfiability by unrestricted, impartial, just and fair computations of the given program.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Orna Lichtenstein", "author_profile_id": "81100312650", "affiliation": "Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel Aviv, Israel 69978", "person_id": "P212299", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Amir Pnueli", "author_profile_id": "81100648459", "affiliation": "The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100 Israel", "person_id": "PP15038449", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/318593.318622", "year": "1985", "article_id": "318622", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Checking that finite state concurrent programs satisfy their linear specification", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=318622"}
