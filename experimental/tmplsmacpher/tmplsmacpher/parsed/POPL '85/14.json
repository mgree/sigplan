PSEP implements a very fine grain, &#8220;greedy&#8221; approach as a highly concurrent system of two processes: an editor and a code generator. The design allows the two processes to execute without locking their shared data objects, utilizing semantic information about the concurrent system to guarantee the consistency of the shared objects.
