{"article_publication_date": "01-01-1985", "fulltext": "\n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "318593", "abstract": "<p><italic>EZ</italic> is a language-based programming environment that offers the services provided separately by programming languages and operating systems in traditional environments. These services are provided as facilities of a high-level string processing language with a 'persistent' memory in which values exist indefinitely or until changed. In <italic>EZ</italic>, strings and associative tables provide traditional file and directory services. This paper concentrates on the use of <italic>EZ</italic> procedures and their activations, which, like other values, have indefinite lifetimes. In <italic>EZ</italic>, the low-level aspects of procedure execution, such as activation record creation, references to local variables, and access to state information, are accessible via high-level language constructs. As a result, traditionally distinct services can be provided by a single service in the <italic>EZ</italic> environment. Furthermore, such services can be written in <italic>EZ</italic> itself. An editor/debugger that illustrates the details of this approach is described.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Christopher W.
