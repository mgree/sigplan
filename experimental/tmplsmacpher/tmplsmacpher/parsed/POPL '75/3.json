The language design was influenced strongly by ECL and Algol-68; some of \nthe more important aspects of CS-4 are as follows: (1) CS-4 has strong type checking and a rich data \ndefinition facility; mode generators include ARRAY, STRUCTURE, POINTER, STATUS, and SET. (2) Procedures \ncan be defined as GENERICS and can be used as prefix or infix operators. (3) Procedures can be compile-time \n, to be invoked during program compilation. (4) CS-4 provides a complete set of structured control-flow \ndeterminers, similar to those in BLISS. (5) The ACCESS statement allows separately compiled modules to \ncommunicate via a strongly checked interface; complete attribute information concerning the ACCESSed \nmodules is thus available to the ACCESSing modules, including any optimization properties ascribed to \nthe ACCESSed functions. Work is currently in progress on the design of a compiler for CS-4 (ultimately \nto be written in CS-4). Early in the development it became apparent that a practical optimizer was important; \nbecause of the similarity of control structure in CS-4 and BLISS, the BLISS\\ll compiler was studied with \nthe intention of adapting and improving their global optimization strategies. This paper presents some \nof the results of this study, the main one of which is a set of new optimization techniques which defer \ncontrol-and data flow-processing until the information is actually required. Such a deferral scheme is \nnecessary for practicality in compilers such as CS-4 S, in which the intermediate representation of a \nprogram is not core-resident. ?i This development was directed by the Naval Electronics Laboratory Center, \nSan Diego, California, under Contract NO0123-74-C-0634. 35\n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "512976", "abstract": "CS-4 is an extensible language currently being developed for the Navy.
