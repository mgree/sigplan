The first is the use of selector names to remove order dependencies from the columns of a relation. This use of selector names enables us to define a more general class of operations, which include the normal relational operations of union, equi-join etc., as special cases. Thirdly we introduce relations represented algorithmically as well as by a stored set of tuples. Such computed relations cannot always be effectively realised as a finite set of tuples. Finally we consider relational expressions as algorithmic representations of relations and characterize their effectiveness.", "authors": [{"name": "Patrick Hall", "author_profile_id": "81100158672", "affiliation": "IBM (UK) Scientific Centre, Durham, England", "person_id": "PP14065417", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Peter Hitchcock", "author_profile_id": "81100367363", "affiliation": "IBM (UK) Scientific Centre, Durham, England", "person_id": "PP14130793", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Stephen Todd", "author_profile_id": "81100524954", "affiliation": "IBM (UK) Scientific Centre, Durham, England", "person_id": "PP35030785", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/512976.512998", "year": "1975", "article_id": "512998", "conference": "POPL", "title": "An algebra of relations for machine computation", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=512998"}
