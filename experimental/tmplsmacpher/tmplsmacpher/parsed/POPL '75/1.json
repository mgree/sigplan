This algorithm combined with a fast node listing constructor due to Aho and Ullman has produced an 0(n log n) algorithm for live analysis. The utility of the node-listing method is demonstrated by an examination of the class of graphs for which \"short\" listings exist. This class is quite similar to the class of graphs for \"understandable\" programs.", "authors": [{"name": "K. W.
