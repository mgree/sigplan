Unfortunately, the performance of current implementations is inadequate for some potential applications. In particular, these implementations tend to be space inefficient, in that they essentially require a complete computation history to be maintained.</p><p>Some numerical analysts (cf. [3]) propose that the programmer instead be provided with variable precision <italic>interval arithmetic</italic>, and then be required to write code to restart a computation when the intervals become too inaccurate. Though this model is no doubt appropriate at times, it is not an adequate replacement for exact arithmetic. The correct transformation from a program operating on the constructive reals to a reasonable program using iterated interval arithmetic can be nontrivial and error prone. Here we present a technique based on <italic>program slicing</italic> to both automate this process and reduce the amount of reexecution. Thus the programmer is still free to use the simpler abstraction of exact real arithmetic, but we can provide a more efficient interval arithmetic based implementation. Some preliminary empirical results are presented.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Vernon A.
