The primary objective of the positioning is to reduce the overhead of the instruction memory hierarchy.</p><p>After initial investigation in the literature, we decided to implement two prototypes for the Hewlett-Packard Precision Architecture (PA-RISC). The first, built on top of the linker, positions code based on whole procedures. This prototype has the ability to move procedures into an order that is determined by a &#8220;closest is best&#8221; strategy.</p><p>The second prototype, built on top of an existing optimizer package, positions code based on basic blocks within procedures. Groups of basic blocks that would be better as straight-line sequences are identified as <italic>chains</italic>. These chains are then ordered according to branch heuristics. Code that is never executed during the data collection runs can be physically separated from the primary code of a procedure by a technique we devised called <italic>procedure splitting</italic>.</p><p>The algorithms we implemented are described through examples in this paper. The performance improvements from our work are also summarized in various tables and charts.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Pettis", "author_profile_id": "81100480288", "affiliation": "Hewlett-Packard Company, California Language Laboratory, 19447 Pruneridge Avenue, Cupertino, California", "person_id": "PP31090275", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Robert C.
