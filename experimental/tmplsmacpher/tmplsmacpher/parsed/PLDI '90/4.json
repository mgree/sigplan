{"article_publication_date": "06-01-1990", "fulltext": "\n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "93542", "abstract": "<p>Most conventional compilers fail to allocate array elements to registers because standard data-flow analysis treats arrays like scalars, making it impossible to analyze the definitions and uses of individual array elements. This deficiency is particularly troublesome for floating-point registers, which are most often used as temporary repositories for subscripted variables.</p><p>In this paper, we present a source-to-source transformation, called <italic>scalar replacement</italic>, that finds opportunities for reuse of subscripted variables and replaces the references involved by references to temporary scalar variables. The objective is to increase the likelihood that these elements will be assigned to registers by the coloring-based register allocators found in most compilers. In addition, we present transformations to improve the overall effectiveness of scalar replacement and show how these transformations can be applied in a variety of loop nest types. Finally, we present experimental results showing that these techniques are extremely effective&#8212;capable of achieving integer factor speedups over code generated by good optimizing compilers of conventional design.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "David Callahan", "author_profile_id": "81100653612", "affiliation": "Tera Computer Company, 400 N 34th St, Suite 300, Seattle, Washington", "person_id": "PP31051738", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Steve Carr", "author_profile_id": "81100072915", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Houston, Texas", "person_id": "PP43115838", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ken Kennedy", "author_profile_id": "81100453545", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Houston, Texas", "person_id": "PP40027435", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/93542.93553", "year": "1990", "article_id": "93553", "conference": "PLDI", "title": "Improving register allocation for subscripted variables", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=93553"}
