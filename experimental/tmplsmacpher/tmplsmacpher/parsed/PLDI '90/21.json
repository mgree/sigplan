The conventional notion of a program slice, the <italic>static slice</italic>, is the set of all statements that <italic>might</italic> affect the value of a given variable occurrence. In this paper, we investigate the concept of the <italic>dynamic slice</italic> consisting of all statements that <italic>actually</italic> affect the value of a variable occurrence for a given program input. The sensitivity of dynamic slicing to particular program inputs makes it more useful in program debugging and testing than static slicing. Several approaches for computing dynamic slices are examined. The notion of a Dynamic Dependence Graph and its use in computing dynamic slices is discussed. The Dynamic Dependence Graph may be unbounded in length; therefore, we introduce the economical concept of a Reduced Dynamic Dependence Graph, which is proportional in size to the number of dynamic slices arising during the program execution.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Hiralal Agrawal", "author_profile_id": "81452609139", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN", "person_id": "P110654", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Joseph R.
