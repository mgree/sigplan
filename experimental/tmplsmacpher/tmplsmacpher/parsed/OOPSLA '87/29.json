As we move from personal to interpersonal computing, we must look for ways to extend our programming paradigms. This research extends the Smalltalk-80 system to send messages transparently to objects residing on remote machines. We discuss two models for remote message sends, describe our current implementation, and suggest areas for future research.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Paul L.
