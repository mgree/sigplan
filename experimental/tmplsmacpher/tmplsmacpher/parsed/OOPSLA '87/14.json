This unification allows us to treat a class as a &#8220;first class citizen&#8221;, to give a circular definition of the first metaclass, to access to the metaclass level and finally to control the instantiation link. Because each object is an instance of another one and because a metaclass is a real class inheriting from another one, the metaclass links can be created indefinitely.</p><p>This uniformity allows us to define the class variables at the metalevel thus suppressing the Smalltalk-80 ambiguity between class variables and instance variables: in our model the instance variables of a class are the class variables of its instances.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Pierre Cointe", "author_profile_id": "81100486926", "affiliation": "Rank Xerox & LITP", "person_id": "PP39045180", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/38765.38822", "year": "1987", "article_id": "38822", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Metaclasses are first class: The ObjVlisp Model", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=38822"}
