The shell can be tailored to a variety of application areas. It is object-oriented in its implementation and structure. Objects and messages are used as the specification language. The basic ingredients of a rule-based production system are provided, with rules treated as objects and defined independently of the classes to which they are applied.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Jim Diederich", "author_profile_id": "81100021378", "affiliation": "Univ. of California, Davis", "person_id": "P140308", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jack Milton", "author_profile_id": "81100102702", "affiliation": "Univ. of California, Davis", "person_id": "PP31089174", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/38765.38813", "year": "1987", "article_id": "38813", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "An object-oriented design system shell", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=38813"}
