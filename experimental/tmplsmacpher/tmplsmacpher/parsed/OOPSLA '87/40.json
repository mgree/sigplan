On the surface, these two activities seem to be moving in a consistent direction. However, at a deeper level, we see difficulties that may inhibit their ending up at the same point. We feel that many of these difficulties are a result of the underlying assumptions that are inherent in the fields of programming language and database systems research. Many of these assumptions are historical and contribute to a set of cultural biases that often prevent the two communities from interacting as effectively as possible.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to try to uncover some of the cultural presuppositions that have inhibited development of a fully integrated database programming language. We have identified database and language features that seem to be difficult to reconcile. We try to uncover the basic problems in these two areas that these features were intended to solve. In order to resolve these problems, we attempt to distinguish fundamental differences from historical artifacts.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Toby Bloom", "author_profile_id": "81100272828", "affiliation": "MIT Laboratory for Computer Science", "person_id": "PP40025541", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Stanley B.
