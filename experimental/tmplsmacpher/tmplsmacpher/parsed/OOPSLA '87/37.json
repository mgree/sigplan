RAPID permits modeling of both the appearance and behavior of operator interfaces. Its main goal is to allow exploration of a greater number of design alternatives by decreasing the time and effort required to generate and evaluate those alternatives. It is a graphically-based system intended to be used by non-programmers. RAPID is implemented in Smalltalk-80.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Freburger", "author_profile_id": "81332499346", "affiliation": "Honeywell Bull", "person_id": "PP31078387", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/38765.38845", "year": "1987", "article_id": "38845", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "RAPID: Prototyping control panel interfaces", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=38845"}
