Opus currently provides a data-driven production system that allows the programmer considerable freedom, including access to the full functionality of the Smalltalk-80 language, and the ability to match rules with arbitrary objects in the environment. We present the goals for the design, a description of the system and its implementation, and discuss issues raised by this approach.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Jane Laursen", "author_profile_id": "81100535060", "affiliation": "Xerox Palo Alto Research Center", "person_id": "P134601", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Robert Atkinson", "author_profile_id": "81406599292", "affiliation": "Xerox Palo Alto Research Center", "person_id": "PP14113247", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/38765.38841", "year": "1987", "article_id": "38841", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Opus: A Smalltalk production system", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=38841"}
