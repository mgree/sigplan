It is a more efficient redesign of the standard Smalltalk specification, and is tailored to suit conventional 32 bit microprocessors. This paper presents the major design changes and optimization techniques used in the BrouHaHa interpreter. The interpreter runs at 30% of the speed of the Dorado on a Sun 3/160 workstation. The implementation is portable because it is written in C.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Eliot Miranda", "author_profile_id": "81100428168", "affiliation": "Univ. of London", "person_id": "P76522", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/38765.38839", "year": "1987", "article_id": "38839", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "BrouHaHa- A portable Smalltalk interpreter", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=38839"}
