Language classes (paradigms) associated with interesting subsets of these features are identified and language design issues for selected paradigms are examined. Orthogonal dimensions that span the object-oriented design space are related to non-orthogonal features of real languages. The self-referential application of object-oriented methodology to the development of object-based language paradigms is demonstrated.</p><p>Delegation is defined as a generalization of inheritance and design alternatives such as non-strict, multiple, and abstract inheritance are considered. Actors and prototypes are presented as examples of classless (delegation based) languages. Processes are classified by their degree of internal concurrency. The potential inconsistency of object-oriented sharing and distributed autonomy is discussed, suggesting that compromises between sharing and autonomy will be necessary in designing strongly typed object-oriented distributed database languages.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Peter Wegner", "author_profile_id": "81332534685", "affiliation": "Brown Univ.", "person_id": "PP39080914", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/38765.38823", "year": "1987", "article_id": "38823", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Dimensions of object-based language design", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=38823"}
