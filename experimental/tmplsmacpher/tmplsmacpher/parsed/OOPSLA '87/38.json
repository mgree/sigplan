This paper describes a tool-assisted process for translating Smalltalk-80 programs into Objective-C#8482;, and shows how the tool, called Producer, is used in practice. To assist others in using this translation tool, we have made Producer publicly available without charge on USENET.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Brad J.
