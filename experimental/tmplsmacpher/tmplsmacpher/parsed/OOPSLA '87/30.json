I describe a technology, based on automatic redefinition of existing functions, that allowed alternative implementations of the fundamental data types of the KEE#8482; knowledge-based system building tool. This technology is applicable in environments where the system's procedures can be subject to programmatic manipulation. It allows the retrofitting of objects into the implementations of other existing systems. The experience of retrofitting objects into KEE provides insight into the issues of the interaction of semantic classes and data representation and granularity in object-based systems.</italic><supscrpt>1</supscrpt></p>", "authors": [{"name": "Robert E.
