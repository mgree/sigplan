The externalization of references between objects permits a symmetric, non-redundant conceptual model which merits its own special notation and predefined operations. The object-relation model, which combines the object-oriented model with the entity-relationship model from data base theory, is particularly useful for designing and partitioning systems of interrelated objects. Relations can be implemented efficiently using hash tables. The model proposed here has been fully implemented in an object-oriented language written by the author which has been used to implement several production applications.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "James Rumbaugh", "author_profile_id": "81100637433", "affiliation": "General Electric", "person_id": "PP31092614", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/38765.38850", "year": "1987", "article_id": "38850", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Relations as semantic constructs in an object-oriented language", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=38850"}
