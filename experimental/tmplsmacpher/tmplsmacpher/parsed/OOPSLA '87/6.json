It can be used for independent data examination or integrated into application user interfaces. Ida's model of graphics is composed of five basic elements: <italic>Presentations, Assemblies, Data Sources, Data Displays</italic>, and <italic>Scales</italic>. Presentations and assemblies address display layout. A sharp distinction is maintained between drawing and the management of already drawn images. Data sources are responsible for drawing while data displays are image managers. Data displays are complex structures consisting of multiple layers that may be larger than the visible regions they underlie. Scales represent coordinate transformations. An object-oriented architecture proves valuable in supporting taxonomic hierarchies with inheritance, part-whole structures for composition, message passing implementation of graphic operations and late attribute binding.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Robert L.
