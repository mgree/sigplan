A composite object explicitly captures and enforces the IS-PART-OF integrity constraint between child and parent pairs of objects in a hierarchical collection of objects. Further, it can be used as a unit of storage and retrieval to enhance the performance of a database system.</p><p>This paper provides a formal definition of the semantics of composite objects within an object-oriented data model, and describes their use as units of integrity control, storage and retrieval, and concurrency control in a prototype object-oriented database system we have implemented.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Won Kim", "author_profile_id": "81414607972", "affiliation": "MCC", "person_id": "PP39078843", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jay Banerjee", "author_profile_id": "81100144485", "affiliation": "MCC", "person_id": "P135709", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Hong-Tai Chou", "author_profile_id": "81451594314", "affiliation": "MCC", "person_id": "P111713", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jorge F.
