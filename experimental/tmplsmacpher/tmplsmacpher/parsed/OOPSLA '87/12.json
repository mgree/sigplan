It has commonly been believed that delegation provides a more powerful model. This paper demonstrates that there is a &#8220;natural&#8221; model of inheritance which captures all of the properties of delegation. Independently, certain constraints on the ability of delegation to capture inheritance are demonstrated. Finally, a new framework which fully captures both delegation and inheritance is outlined, and some of the ramifications of this hybrid model are explored.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Lynn Andrea Stein", "author_profile_id": "81100214014", "affiliation": "Brown Univ.", "person_id": "PP39079652", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/38765.38820", "year": "1987", "article_id": "38820", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Delegation is inheritance", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=38820"}
