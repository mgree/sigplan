{"article_publication_date": "01-26-1981", "fulltext": "\n Forward Debate: The Role of Global Optimization in Compilers of the Future At previous POPL$s, a number \nof papers have been presented on global flow analysis algorithms and compiler designs to exploit them. \nAt the same POPLts, another group of papers have dealt with generation of good code for small program \nsegments (principally DAG ~s) and compilers to utilize them. This debate brings together exponents of \neach of these schools of algorithmic and compiler design. We hope that this forum will give the audience \na better idea of the overall compiler structure that each point of view induces. But there are other \nissues that we hope will be brought into sharper focus. Among these are: Are global optimization techniques \nintrinsically slower than local methods if reason\u00adably good code is required? What is the relation between \nthe structure and semantics of a programming language and the choice of compiler technique? How does \nthe architecture of a machine affect one s choice of technique? Is one technique clearly more reliable \nthan the other?, Finally, we hope the discussion will clarify the issue: Are global optimization techniques \na remnant of the past or the wave of the future?
