In contrast, process distinguishability in Hoare's theory of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is determined solely on the basis of traces of visible actions. We examine what additional operations are needed to explain bisimulation similarly&#8212;specifically in the case of finitely branching processes without silent moves. We formulate a general notion of Structured Operational Semantics for processes with Guarded recursion (GSOS), and demonstrate that bisimulation does <italic>not</italic> agree with trace congruence with respect to any set of GSOS-definable contexts. In justifying the generality and significance of GSOS's, we work out some of the basic proof theoretic facts which justify the SOS discipline.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "B.
