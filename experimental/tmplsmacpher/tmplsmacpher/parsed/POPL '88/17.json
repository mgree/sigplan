The result of this derivation is a compilation algorithm which performs type checking before code generation so that type-checking instructions are not generated in the target code. Both the flow analysis and the resulting optimizations are proved correct with respect to the original definition of the source language. The proof consists of showing that all restructuring transformations preserve the semantics of the source language. This transformational approach can be extended to derive correctness proofs of other flow analysis and code optimization techniques.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "M.
