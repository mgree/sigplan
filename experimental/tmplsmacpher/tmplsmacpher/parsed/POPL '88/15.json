With the introduction of prompt-applications, the control calculus becomes a traditional calculus all of whose equations imply operational equivalence. In addition, prompt-applications enhance the expressiveness and efficiency of the language. We illustrate the latter claim with examples from such distinct areas as systems programming and tree processing.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Mattias Felleisen", "author_profile_id": "81100323458", "affiliation": "Indiana University, Computer Science Department, Lindley Hall 101, Bloomington, IN", "person_id": "PP39071682", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/73560.73576", "year": "1988", "article_id": "73576", "conference": "POPL", "title": "The theory and practice of first-class prompts", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=73576"}
