Many rescheduling techniques like loop interchange, loop strip-mining or rectangular partitioning have been described to speedup program execution. We present here a class of partitionings that encompasses previous techniques and provides enough flexibility to adapt code to multiprocessors with two levels of parallelism and two levels of memory.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "F.
