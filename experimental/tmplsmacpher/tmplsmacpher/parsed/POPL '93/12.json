The only computational structure we introduce is a set of bindings which corresponds closely to a heap. The semantics is set at a considerably higher level of abstraction than operational semantics for particular abstract machines, so is more suitable for a variety of proofs. Furthermore, because a heap is explicitly modelled, the semantics provides a suitable framework for studies about space behaviour of terms under lazy evaluation.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "John Launchbury", "author_profile_id": "81100462557", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP39074870", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/158511.158618", "year": "1993", "article_id": "158618", "conference": "POPL", "title": "A natural semantics for lazy evaluation", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=158618"}
