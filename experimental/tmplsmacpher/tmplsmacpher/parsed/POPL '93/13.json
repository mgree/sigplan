Reynolds School \nof Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890, USA j ohn. reynolds(!cs. cmu. \nedu Abstract The logical relations (or abstraction) theorem for the simply typed lambda calculus [1, \n2] asserts that any function definable in the calculus maps related arguments into related results, where \nthe meaning of related is arbitrary for type variables but induced in a fixed way for higher types. In \naddition to showing that the type system enforces abstraction, this theorem is a rich source of laws \nabout definable functions of particular types [3]. For the polymorphic lambda calculus [4, 5, 6], the \nlogical relations theorem suggests a plausible definition of Strachey s concept of parametricity [7], \ni.e. that definable polymorphic functions treat types uniformly. This definition implies that certain \nlow-order polymorphic types can be used as algebraic data types [8, 9, 2]. In this tutorial, we will \ntry to explain the intuitions behind these ideas without becoming enmeshed in the mathematical complexities \nof defining the polymorphic lambda calculus rigorously. *This research was sponsored in part by National \nScience Foundation Grant CCR-8922109 and in part by the Avionics Lab, Wright Research and Development \nCenter, Aeronautical Systems Division (AFSC), U.S. Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-6543 under \nContract F33615-90-C-1465, Arpa Order No. 7597.
