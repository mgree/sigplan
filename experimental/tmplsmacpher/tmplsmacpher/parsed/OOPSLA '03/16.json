The project should \nresult in (a) a tool that fulfils the MDA promise for faster/more accurate/better maintainable application \ndevelopment, (b) a tool for industrial use, and (c) MDA related research which is encouraged and needed. \nA distinctive feature of GMT is the emphasis of model transformations as \"first-class model citizens\". \nThe implementation of model transformations is envisaged to be in conformance with the future OMG modeling \nstandard for Queries, Views, and Transformations (QVT).

Keywords Model Driven Architecture (MDA), Generative Model Transformer (GMT), \nmodel transformation, QVT, domain-specific languages, Open Source. 1. INTRODUCTION The GMT project is \nthe result of a BOF session following the OOPSLA'02 workshop Generative Techniques in the Context of \nMDA [2]. For further background on GMT we refer to the abstract of the OOSPLA'03 poster \"Generative Model \nTransformer: An Open Source MDA Tool Initiative\" in the OOPSLA'03 Companion and to the GMT project's \nweb site [1]. The GMT project has just started, and we are currently concentrating on the design of the \ncore architecture that will allow various MDA tool components to plug-in to GMT, such that GMT Copyright \nis held by the author/owner(s). OOPSLA 03, October 26 30, 2003, Anaheim, California, USA. ACM 1-58113-751-6/03/0010. \n Ghica van Emde Boas Bronstee Software &#38; Services Franz Lisztlaan 5 2102 CJ Heemstede Netherlands \n emdeboas@bronstee.com manages the workflow and co-ordinates model transformations across a chain of \nMDA components. The GMT project intends to leverage existing assets such as the FUUT-je model-driven \ntemplate language based generator developed by Ghica van Emde Boas, and to integrate with other Open \nSource tools such as the Eclipse IDE framework [10]. The GMT project will develop new components for \nadvanced model\u00adto-model and model-to-text transformations. Currently FUUT-je has been made available \nin Open Source format, and first work has started on UMLX, an Open Source Graphical Transformation Language \nfor MDA [9]. 2. SCOPE OF THE DEMONSTRATION By October 2003 we expect to be in a position to demonstrate \nthe GMT backbone and initial prototype MDA tool components. We intend to provide an overview of the GMT \narchitecture, explaining how we envisage MDA tool components for specific types of transformations to \nplug into GMT. The demonstration will be based on an example of a small e\u00adcommerce application that is \nmodeled as a platform independent model (PIM), and will show how this model is transformed into platform \nspecific source specifications and a working application using GMT tool components. The translation from \nPIM to source specifications will rely on template language-based transformation technology, as the development \nand implementation of a graphical transformation language is still work-in-progress. The demonstration \nis intended to be highly interactive, and we invite the audience to contribute their requirements for \nmodel transformations and text/code generation. We may also use the opportunity to gather feedback on \nthe priorities in the GMT project roadmap.
