Panel Reuse Repositories and Reuse The Realities Dave Thomas (Chair) Brian Barry Bedarra Research \nLabs &#38; Carleton University Bedarra Research Labs &#38; eclipse.org Ivar Jacobson Linda Northrop \nClemens Szyperski Jaczone Software Engineering Institute Microsoft Research ABSTRACT This panel (part \nof the 2003 Onward! program) will discuss li\u00adbraries, repositories, and reuse. While there is so much \nhype and noise about repositories and metadata - so little understood about how hard it is to design \nfor reuse and to encourage systematic reuse. Categories &#38; Subject Descriptors: D.2.2 Design Tools \nand Techniques: Software libraries D.2.9 Management D.2.13 Reusable Software General Terms: Design, Management, \nStandardization Keywords: Software Reuse, Libraries, Repositories, System\u00adatic Reuse  1. Dave Thomas, \ndave@bedarra.com Dave Thomas (Bedarra Research Labs, Carleton University and University of Queensland) \nis a popular keynote speaker and a recognized international expert in: software engineering; virtual \nmachines; object technology; embedded systems and end-user programming. Dave is best known to the Smalltalk \ncommunity as the founder of Object Technology International (OTI) developers of Envy/Developer a unique \nCM environment for object oriented development; virtual machines (Smalltalk/Vmac and Envy/Small\u00adtalk) \nand IDEs for IBM VisualAge for Smalltalk; for Java; Micro Edition for Embedded Systems and Eclipse. In \nrecognition of his contributions to object technology Dave was elected to the IBM Academy. He is currently \nCEO of Bedarra Corporation, which he founded in 1998. Bedarra provides assistance to new ventures both \nin new and existing companies as well as R&#38;D and com\u00adpetitive analysis. Bedarra focuses on the transfer \nof research from the lab to commercial success. Bedarra has assisted more than 30 companies in Australia, \nCanada, the US and Europe. Bedarra is currently focused on: eLearning; Next Generation Application Development; \nAgile Software Development and Pervasive Com\u00adputing. Dave was recently appointed a founding Director \nin Agile Alliance, which promotes fast user, focused software develop\u00adment. He is on the editorial board \nof the new online Journal of Object Technology (JOT) and a columnist in Otland. Dave is an adjunct research \nprofessor at Carleton University and the Univer\u00adsity of Queensland in Brisbane Australia where he works \nwith the DSTC research lab. 2. Brian Barry, brian@bedarra.com Brian Barry is currently CEO of Bedarra \nResearch Labs. From 1991-2002 he served variously as Chief Scientist, CEO, President and CTO at Object \nTechnology International, Inc. Under his lead\u00adership OTI developed the Eclipse IDE Platform, IBM VisualAge \nfor Java, and IBM VisualAge MicroEdition for embedded sys\u00adtems. Brian has over 20 years of experience \nin the design and implementation of object-oriented and component-based systems, including distributed, \nclient/server, embedded and real-time ap\u00adplications. He has published a number of research papers and \narticles on a variety of subjects, including simulation, OO appli\u00adcations, systems integration, embedded \nsystems and software en\u00adgineering, and is a frequent speaker on object technology. Brian is a founding \nmember of eclipse.org and holds several Board level positions with that organization. He has served on \nthe Program Committees for software conferences such as OOPSLA, ECOOP, AOSD and Agile Development. Brian \nwas a charter member of the ANSI Smalltalk committee and a co-author of the Smalltalk standard. He remains \nactive in research review boards and com\u00admittees. He holds a Ph.D. from Queen's University.  3. Ivar \nJacobson, ivar@jaczone.com Ivar Jacobson is a father of: use cases, component-based devel\u00adopment, the \nUnified Modeling Language, the Rational Unified Process, and business modelling with use cases and objects. \nIvar Jacobson founded the Swedish company Objectory AB, which merged with Rational Software Corporation \nin 1995. He departed recently from IBM/Rational, and is now pursuing other ideas. One of them is with \nJaczone AB, a company he founded three years ago with his daughter Agneta Jacobson. Jaczone is imple\u00admenting \nan old vision of Ivar to make software process execute, to make it invisible yet very present. Jacobson \nis the principal author of five leading books on use cases, component-based de\u00advelopment, software reuse, \nthe unified process, and business mod\u00adeling. Ivar was recently awarded the Gustaf Dal\u00e9n Medal by The \nChalmers Alumni Association. Copyright is held by the author(s)/owner(s). 4.
