Today, many vendors are now producing products that support MDA. We are hearing more and more success stories that indicate that this technology is the \"real deal\". But, with the failed promises of CASE in the late 1980's, many people still have questions about how much of an application can really be generated from models and constraint languages. Is MDA really capable of generating enterprise applications? What are the technologies are available to implement MDA? This panel examines the technologies and tools behind Model Driven Architecture. Each panelist has been intricately involved in building the underlying foundations of Model Driven Architecture and implementation.There are many possible implementations of MDA including action semantics and the object constraint language. This panel will examine: What is the future of MDA? Will the \"model driven\" approach replace \"high-level\" languages as \"high-level\" languages replaced assembly languages? What are the challenges with using an MDA approach? How can a project get started using MDA?", "authors": [{"name": "Granville Miller", "author_profile_id": "81100160769", "affiliation": "Borland", "person_id": "PP14066386", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Andy Evans", "author_profile_id": "81100485717", "affiliation": "Xactium", "person_id": "PP39045101", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ivar Jacobson", "author_profile_id": "81100030692", "affiliation": "JacZone", "person_id": "P117558", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Henrik Jondell", "author_profile_id": "81100454137", "affiliation": "Borland", "person_id": "P643451", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Allan Kennedy", "author_profile_id": "81538088756", "affiliation": "Kennedy Carter", "person_id": "PP14158367", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Stephen Mellor", "author_profile_id": "81100022477", "affiliation": "Project Technology", "person_id": "P268598", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Dave Thomas", "author_profile_id": "81100412131", "affiliation": "Bedarra Research Labs", "person_id": "PP43119689", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/949344.949409", "year": "2003", "article_id": "949409", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Model driven architecture: how far have we come, how far can we go?", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=949409"}
