Laura Hill (Chair) Sun Microsystems, Inc Harlan Sexton Oracle Corp David West New Mexico \nHighlands Dick Gabriel Sun Microsystems, Inc Kevin Tyson Independent Consultant University &#38; University \nof New Mexico ABSTRACT Freedom to innovate is one of the key motivators for many tech\u00adnical workers. \nUnfortunately, although innovation is often trum\u00adpeted as a key company attribute, it seems that many \norganiza\u00adtions struggle to provide the necessary environment - even those organizations whose original \nclaim to fame lay in their ability to innovate. This panel will look at the barriers to innovation that \noccur in a variety of environments: large, well-established organi\u00adzations, start-ups, academia, standards \nbodies and the open source community. Panelists will propose a set of technical and non\u00adtechnical techniques \nthat can be used to foster innovation in even the most lethargic or hostile environment. Categories \n&#38; Subject Descriptors: K.7 [The Computing Profession]: Organizations General Terms: Human Factors, \nExperimentation Keywords: Innovation, People, Culture.  1. Laura Hill, laura.hill@sun.com Laura Hill \nis the Assistant Director of Sun Microsystems Research Laboratories. She has been involved with the object-oriented \ncommunity for over 14 years focusing on reuse, emerging tech\u00adnologies, methodology and organization migration. \nA think tank based on this subject was delivered at OT2003 in Cambridge, England. 2. Dick Gabriel, rpg@dreamsongs.org \nInnovation is easy: All you need is a high enough density of trig\u00adgers with someone or some people prepared \nand able to combine and react to what they observe. Triggers and being open are all that are needed. \nOpen source has the potential to do this in abundance, even though the rap on open source is that it \nhas never produced any\u00adthing new. This belief is belied by the sheer bulk of open source projects: SourceForge \nhosts about 60,000 projects, Freshmeat reports on almost 30,000, and the Free Software Foundation Re\u00adpository \nhas 2,000 projects. Freshmeat lists nearly 10,000 projects intended for end users, dispelling the myth \nthat open source pro\u00adduces only tools and infrastructure.

The second part \nof creating something is to revise and hone it, based perhaps on the reaction of an audience which may \ngo by the name \"customers.\" And as with any creative activity, what emerges as winners are those selected \nfor that honor-and some\u00adtimes the best are the winners. In the open-source world, the realm of software \nand open-source communities supply the triggers, and the large number of people supply the open-mindedness. \nThere are few cost impediments beyond time to indulge in the creative act. What makes other venues non-innovative \nare a combination of the absence of triggers, limited diversity, close-mindedness, lack of adventurousness, \nresources to watch a number of revisions, and a fear of picking something to back Dick Gabriel is a Distinguished \nEngineer and chief scientist of a small laboratory at Sun Microsystems, researching the architec\u00adture, \ndesign, and implementation of extraordinarily large systems as well as development techniques for building \nthem. He is Sun's open source expert, advising the company on community-based strategies. He is also \nPresident of the Hillside Group, a nonprofit that nurtures the software patterns community by holding \nconfer\u00adences, publishing books, and awarding scholarships. 3. Harlan Sexton, harlan.sexton@oracle.com \nSoftware development has been a haven for technical people that want the freedom to try new things, but \nmy feeling is that not a lot has come of their efforts. Some fairly obvious innovations have had very \nlarge consequences (e.g., the internet), but I don't see any sign that we understand what we're doing \nany better now than when I started programming. The rise of open software gives me some hope that programmers \nwill become less terrible, since now anyone can look at a large collection of competently written pro\u00adgrams \nthat work. But I think that we need more than social inno\u00advations if we have any hope of learning to \nmake use of the hard\u00adware we have already, much less the hardware that is and will be feasible. Harlan \nis a retread mathematician who has been programming since 1981. His first real job was as a mathematician \nwith N.O.S.C in San Diego, CA, and he currently works as a pro\u00adgrammer for Oracle Corporation in Redwood \nCity, CA. 4. Kevin Tyson, kptyson@earthlink.net While the freedom to innovate is indeed one of the key \nmotivators of many technical workers, innovation, in and of itself, is not an unadulterated good in all \ncircumstances and at all times. From the Phaistos Disk to the many innovations of Xerox PARC, examples \nabound of innovation that either contributed nothing to the com\u00admonweal or little to the good fortune \nof the innovation's pro\u00adgenitor. Innovation succeeds in a context. Its success, meaning adoption of the \ninnovation as an accepted practice, is inexorably followed by its relegation to the nether reaches of \nthe legacy world. It is within the context of this full lifecycle that the techni\u00adcal worker is motivated \nand within which we can refine our focus to barriers to successful innovation. Purposeful enterprises, \norganized to deliver some good or service -be they open source projects or firms in the armaments industry \n\u00admay consume innovation and, by its refinement, produce better GUI widgets or gun widgets. Sclerotic \nenterprises competing in lethargic markets can succeed without fostering innovation re\u00adgardless of their \nsize, longevity or market gravitas. Such firms should not be sought out by those technical workers seeking \ngrati\u00adfication through innovation. If, as Oracle's Larry Ellison recently suggested, innovation in the \ncomputer industry will be controlled by \"a handful of category-dominating winners\" then perhaps the entire \ncomputer industry should be considered out of scope by those technical workers. Industry-wide and internationally \nrecognized software, network\u00ading and communications standards provide an important waypoint on an innovations \npath from au courant to ancien r\u00e9gime. It is within the hallowed halls of ISO, OMG, W3C, IETF, JCP, etc, \nthat processes, some themselves innovative others rather more pedestrian, attempt to transform innovation \ninto accepted practice. Perhaps both the diminished participation of industry in these activities and \nthe concomitant rise of the open source world bear witness to the validity of Mr. Ellison's predictions. \nKevin Tyson is an independent consultant with more than 25 years of experience building mission-critical \ninformation systems for financial services organizations. He has designed and pro\u00adgrammed systems for \nfunds transfer, equities, fixed-income and derivatives trading, settlement, clearance, and compliance \nopera\u00adtions. Mr. Tyson has been an active participant in the Financial Domain Task Force and Architecture \nBoard of the Object Man\u00adagement Group. 5. David West, dwest@cs.nmhu.edu. Innovation must be nurtured, \nboth internally and externally. Organizations can create a culture supportive of innovation and risk \ntaking. Individuals, however, must take it upon themselves to adopt appropriate \"ways of thinking\" compatible \nwith innova\u00adtion before they can avail themselves of the context provided by the organization. Dave has \nbeen a professional developer (programmer to consult\u00adant) since 1968 and an academic since 1988. He claims \nexpertise in object-oriented analysis and design and developed object cur\u00adricula at three different Object \nThinking for Extreme Program\u00admers and Agile Developers universities. Microsoft Press will pub\u00adlish his \nfirst book . just in time for OOPSLA 2003. \n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "949344", "abstract": "Freedom to innovate is one of the key motivators for many technical workers.
