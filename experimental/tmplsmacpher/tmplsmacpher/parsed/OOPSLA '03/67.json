The project should result in (a) a tool that fulfils the MDA promise for faster/more accurate/better maintainable application development, (b) a tool for industrial use, and (c) MDA related research-which is encouraged and needed. A distinctive feature of GMT is the emphasis of model transformations as \"first-class model citizens\". The implementation of model transformations is envisaged to be in conformance with the future OMG modeling standard for Queries, Views, and Transformations (QVT).", "authors": [{"name": "Jorn Bettin", "author_profile_id": "81100085010", "affiliation": "SoftMetaWare, Waiheke Island, Auckland, New Zealand", "person_id": "P643461", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ghica van Emde Boas", "author_profile_id": "81100521121", "affiliation": "Bronstee Software & Services, CJ Heemstede, Netherlands", "person_id": "P97234", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "E.D.
