Steve Berczuk (Chair) Neil Harrison Kevlin Henney \nIndependent Consultant Avaya Labs Curbralan Joshua Kerievsky Industrial Logic Linda Rising Independent \nConsultant ABSTRACT Agile Methods are advocated as a way of producing better soft\u00adware. Advocates of \nagile methods suggest that practices such as keeping in close communication with your customers, frequent \nintegration, and frequent assessment of project status will enable us to produce software that has value \nfor the customer quality software. It s hard to argue with that. But why is this any different than \nsimply good software development practice? Why does saying Scrum Agile or XP grab peoples attention? \nWhy does it take a name for useful practices to be accepted? This panel will help us understand the role \nof hype in getting use\u00adful practices accepted or rejected. We will explore why it is that these good \nideas have not been more widely used. Some of the questions that the panel and the audience will explore \nare: Why do we ignore proven practices until we see them packaged as a method? Can we do something different \nin the workplace or in school to teach these practices? Or is it the case that these prac\u00adtices are not \nuniversally good? This panel talks about agility in a different context than what is typical: we won \nt just discuss what agile practices are. We will explore why they are not more widely adopted, especially \nwhen not packaged as part of a named method like XP. And we will discuss why projects suffer even when \nthe methods that can help them are well known. This panel will provide an entertaining and thought provoking \nforum for discussing an issue that is ever present in the world of technology: the role of hype. We concentrate \non agile practices, moving beyond simply enumerating them, to discussing why they are not more widely \nadopted.

Steve Berczuk, steve@berczuk.com \nSteve has been developing object-oriented software applications since 1989, often as part of geographically \ndistributed teams where flexibility and agility were essential. He has been an active member of the Software \nPatterns community since 1994 and has published a number of articles on the relationship between or\u00adganization, \nsoftware architecture, and design patterns. He has an M.S. in Operations Research from Stanford University \nand an S.B. in Electrical Engineering from MIT. Steve is the author of the book Software Configuration \nManagement Patterns: Effective Teamwork, Practical Integration, published by Addison Wesley (www.scmpatterns.com), \nwhich is about software configuration management in an agile environment. Steve wonders why some projects \nfail because they don t use practices known to be effective, and why others fail because they use hyped \nprocesses inappropriately. This panel presents an opportunity to have an interesting and productive discussion \non the role of hype in acceptance and rejection of effective tech\u00adniques. Between the contributions of \nthe panelists and those of the audience this panel should be informative and entertaining.  2. Neil \nHarrison, nbharrison@avaya.com Neil Harrison is a researcher at Avaya Labs, where he consults with software \nprojects in software architecture, process, organiza\u00adtions, estimation, and product line engineering. \nHe has studied the application of agile development methods in large organizations, and has practiced \nagile software development. He has been in\u00advolved in software patterns since 1994. He has organized pattern \nconferences and has taught many courses on patterns, especially in the area of pattern shepherding. He \nis currently a member of the board of directors of the Hillside group. He has published patterns and \narticles in several pattern books, and was the lead editor of Pattern Languages of Program Design, Volume \n4. Neil sees many attitudes towards agile methods, and two of par\u00adticular interest: One camp has been \ndoing agile practices for years, and wonders what all the fuss is about. The other camp sees that not \nall practices are appropriate in all situations, and correctly asks, What s so right about doing things \neXtreme? These are two of several reasons that agile practices aren t adopted: first, that they are already \nbeing done, and second, that they sometimes shouldn t be done.

Kevlin \nHenney is an independent consultant and trainer. The fo-ACM 1-58113-751-6/03/0010. cus of his work is \nin programming languages, OO, CBD, UML, patterns, and software architecture. He is a regular columnist \nfor Application Development Advisor (UK), JavaSpektrum (Ger\u00admany), and C/C++ Users Journal online, and \na former columnist with Java Report and C++ Report. He is also program chair for the EuroPLoP 2003 conference, \na member of Hillside Europe and the OT conference program committee, as well a regular speaker at conferences \nin the US and Europe. Kevlin s position on this issue is that if practice makes perfect, the absence \nof practice is one of the main problems that many compa\u00adnies, projects and individuals seem to be suffering \nfrom. Some\u00adtimes it feels like companies would rather adopt practices in name only, leaving adoption \nin deed as an irrelevant implementation detail. 4. Joshua Kerievsky, joshua@industriallogic.com Joshua \nKerievsky has been programming professionally since 1987, and is the founder of Industrial Logic, a company \nspecializ\u00ading in Extreme Programming (XP). Since 1999, Joshua has been coaching and programming on small, \nlarge and distributed XP projects and teaching XP to people throughout the world. He is the author of \nnumerous XP and patterns-based articles, simula\u00adtions and games, including the forthcoming book, Refactoring \nto Patterns (http://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring) Joshua s perspective on this issue is that long \nbefore the agile hype, small numbers of talented teams and organizations success\u00adfully practiced agile \nprocesses. Yet we never heard about their successes. Large-scale, agile development adoption only occurred \nafter the world inherited simple, concise explanations of the magic. We remain indebted to such authors \nto this day.  5. Linda Rising, risingl@acm.org Linda Rising has a Ph.D. from Arizona State University \nin the area of object-based design metrics. Her background includes university teaching experience as \nwell as work in industry in the areas of telecommunications, avionics, and strategic weapons systems. \nShe has been working with object technologies since 1983. Linda is an independent consultant who helps \norganizations get started with agile methods, especially Scrum She is the author, with Mary Lynn Manns, \nof the book Fear Less and Other Patterns for Introducing New Ideas into Organizations, and is the editor \nof A Patterns Handbook, A Pat\u00adtern Almanac 2000, and Design Patterns in Communications Software. She \nhas a number of publications including: The Scrum Software Development Process for Small Teams, IEEE \nSoftware, July-August 2001, Agile Meetings, STQQE, July/August 2002, and The Role of Product Champion \nSTQE, March 2003. These and other articles are available on her web site: lindarising.org. She is a regular \ncontributor to the DDC-I On-line Newsletter: ddci.com/news_latest_news_archive.shtml Linda sees some \ninstant successes and some slow adopters. Some teams want to say they re agile--they get caught up in \nthe hype but just keep on doing development as usual. She keeps learning about what works well and what \nshould be done differently with each experience. 6. Ken Schwaber, ken.schwaber@verizon.net Ken is one \nof the developers of the Scrum agile process and is an author to the Agile Manifesto. He is currently \nChair of the Agile Alliance, has presented at numerous conferences and user groups, and is author of \nAgile Software Development with Scrum with Mike Beedle. Ken has developed, managed and consulted about \nsoftware development for over 30 years. He is concerned as Scrum and Agile move from the early adopters \nto the mainstream that it retain its vigor, integrity, and utility. Similarly to CMM, he has more frequently \nbeen hearing of Agile users that are agile in name only. 7. Bobby Woolf, bwoolf@us.ibm.com Bobby Woolf \nhas been developing multi-tier object-oriented business applications for thirteen years using Java/J2EE, \nSmall\u00adtalk, and embedded systems for messaging, workflow, business rules, and persistence. He is a co-author \nof the new book Enter\u00adprise Integration Patterns (www.eaipatterns.com) from Addison-Wesley. He became \nfocused on writing and using patterns after watching projects fail for lack of simple, well-known solutions. \nNow he s seeing projects fail for lack of simple, well-known prac\u00adtices. Kent Beck said it best, quoting \nRon Jefferies, XP is what pro\u00adgrammers do in their own natural environment. As my friend Randy Stafford \nis fond of saying, Why should we debate what the machine will do best? Why don t we ask the machine what \nit does best? As developers, we know when we re making progress. And customers can see when we re making \nprogress. When we don t know how well the machine will make progress, try some\u00adthing and see how it goes. \nThe problem with XP is that it relies on doing what works, regardless of the consequences, and that is \nnot in fact the goal of a lot of organizations. The question to ask is: Which is more important, doing \nthings your way, or producing good software?  \n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "949344", "abstract": "Agile Methods are advocated as a way of producing better software.
