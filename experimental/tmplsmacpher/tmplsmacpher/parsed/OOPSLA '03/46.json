The truth is that certifications in general offer significant advantages, but it \nis important not to overestimate their benefits. In this paper, we describe our experiences on teaching \na workshop aimed at preparing undergraduate students for the Sun Certified Java Programmer exam. But \nfirst, we layout the real value of IT certifications and explain the different certification options \navailable for Java technology.

BACKGROUND Back in 1996 and 1997, our university s Computer Science department \nstarted teaching Java in two elective courses: Advanced Computer Graphics and Object Oriented Software \nConstruction. Both of these courses were offered to undergraduate Computer Science and Computer Engineering \nsenior students. We didn t take too long to realize that Java was in many cases more convenient than \nother languages we had been using so far. Thus, we stared to promote the use of Java in other Computer \nScience courses. By the year 2000, we had adopted the Java language as the official CS1 programming language \nin our Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electronic Engineering and Information Systems undergraduate \nprograms. In that same year, our department was already engaged teaching certification-related courses \nwith Cisco [3] and Carnegie Technology Education [7] (currently known as iCarnegie). Given the thrust \nwe had with Java, it only seemed reasonable to extend our certification offerings in order to include \nJava as well. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). OOPSLA 03, October 26 30, 2003, Anaheim, California, \nUSA. ACM 1-58113-751-6/03/0010. In 2002, we offered for the first time an elective course called Java \nCertification Workshop . The rest of this paper describes how we got about this course and our experiences \nteaching it. 2. VALUE OF IT CERTIFICATIONS There are important discrepancies on the industry s perceived \nvalue regarding Information Technology certifications. Some recruiters and hiring managers have stated \nthat they see Java certification as an unimpressive credential, and that they consider hands-on experience \na much more valuable asset [15]. Others claim that getting certified virtually guaranties a substantial \nsalary raise. For example, according to a survey conducted by CRN on 2002, a Sun certified Java developer \nwas earning annually 22,550 USD more than a non-certified developer [11]. An adequate balance has to \nbe found between these opposite points of view. Some sources, such as [9], state that certification is \na tool that people successfully use to challenge themselves. Additionally, it serves as evidence that \na person is self-motivated and actively working to stay current. And, indeed, most experts agree that \ncertification is definitely no substitute for extensive hands-on experience. Certification serves as \na proof for qualification and suitability for a certain kind of task. This can be very important in order \nto gain the customers confidence, or it may even be mandatory in some cases. For example, the Mexican \ncompany PROSA, regional leader in the interconnection and information interchange industry, relies on \noutsourcing for all their software development projects, which are currently based on J2EE technology. \nOne thing they expect from all of their IT suppliers is that their staff members be Java certified [1]. \nFor entry-level IT positions or roles that involve mostly technical knowledge, IT certifications are \na useful way to measure knowledge, screen applicants and assist in promotion decisions [6]. Certification \nprograms generate product and company recognition. This means that people who get certified also get \nthe benefits of the marketing power of corporations and professional organizations. This is why vendor \nparticipation is one of the major forces driving certification growth. Industry vendors understand that \nthe more people who master their product, the more often people will use it. From an academic point of \nview, Computer Science departments should be educating students on how to adapt to changing technologies, \nand not training them on how to use particular tools. Preparing undergraduate students for certification \nmay seem like a shift from this premise. On the other hand, employers commonly assert that recently graduated \nstudents are lacking some of the practical skills required in real world situations. We believe that \na reasonable balance can be found between the industry s requirements and what the academia considers \nto be the right thing. The certification workshop described in section 4 is an elective course which \ncomplements our university s undergraduate Computer Science program and does in no way seek to substitute \nits core essence. 3. JAVA CERTIFICATION OPTIONS There seems to be an ongoing discussion on how Java \ntesting should be carried out [12]. Is the objective to test whether the candidate knows all about the \nJava language, including those seldom used features? Or is it to test the programmer s knowledge of writing \napplied Java ? Or should the candidate take the Java test in the context of the larger set of tools that \nhave grown up around the Java platform? Currently, three organizations respond to these questions in \ntheir own specific ways: Sun Microsystems, ProsoftTraining, and the jCert Initiative. The following sections \nreview what each of these has to offer. 3.1 Sun s Java Technology Certification Path Sun offers these \nJava technology certifications [13]: Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform. This certification \nis for programmers experienced in using the basic syntax and structure of the Java programming language. \nCertification consists of one exam. It has no prerequisites.  Sun Certified Developer for the Java 2 \nPlatform. This certification is for programmers who are already familiar with the basic structure and \nsyntax of the Java programming language, and who have a need to further apply this knowledge to developing \ncomplex, production\u00adlevel applications. Certification consists of two elements: a programming assignment \nand an essay exam. Candidates must be Sun Certified Java Programmers.  Sun Certified Web Component Developer \nfor the J2EE Platform. This certification is for programmers who are using the Java technology servlet \nand JavaServer Pages APIs to develop Web applications. The certification consists of one exam. Candidates \nmust be Sun Certified Java Programmers.  Sun Certified Enterprise Architect for J2EE Technology.  This \ncertification is for enterprise architects responsible for architecting and designing J2EE compliant \napplications, which are scalable, flexible and highly secure. Certification consists of three elements: \na knowledge-based multiple-choice exam, an assignment and essay exam. It has no prerequisites. 3.2 ProsoftTraining \nCIW Certifications The CIW certification program validates job-role skills competency for entry-level \njob seekers and seasoned professionals alike. Candidates can earn CIW certificates in various information \ntechnology job roles, from the foundational CIW Associate certification, continuing to CIW Professional \nand specialization certifications, and up to advanced-level Master CIW certifications [4]. CIW spans \nvarious IT disciplines, including Web site design, enterprise development, network administration and \nsecurity, as well as cross-functional areas that combine other disciplines, such as Web site management \nand Web development. The choices offered by the CIW program allow individuals to focus on pursuing personal \ninterests and talents. The CIW program has three Java related certifications and paths: CIW Web Develop \nCertification A certified Web Developer has the skills and knowledge required to assemble and maintain \nJava based Web applications. Web Developers are familiar with Java, but do not necessarily write Java \nprogram code. Instead, they may use advanced Java development tools that perform basic Java programming, \nallowing Web Developers to focus on the business-requirements aspect of the application development cycle. \nCertification consists of one exam. It has no prerequisites, although the Associate Certification (CIW \nFoundations) is recommended before attempting the Web Developer Certification. This certification corresponds \nto jCert s Web Developer job role.  CIW Professional Certification (CIW Enterprise Specialist). A CIW \nEnterprise Specialist builds n-tier database business solutions using Java in conjunction with distributed \napplication architecture technologies such as Enterprise JavaBeans and CORBA. The Enterprise Specialist \ndesigns, develops and deploys complete software solutions tailored to a given business domain. Certification \nconsists of one exam. Prerequisite: Associate Certification (CIW Foundations).  Master CIW Enterprise \nDeveloper. This certification prepares skilled professionals to develop enterprise-wide Web-enabled applications \nand implement complex e\u00adbusiness solutions. Master CIW Enterprise Developers have advanced skills in \ndatabase management, distributed object computing, scripting and programming languages, and language \ntheory. Certification consists of eight exams; one of them is the Sun Certified Java Programmer.  3.3 \njCert Job Role Certification Tracks The jCert Initiative Inc., established in November 1999, is a nonprofit \norganization sponsored by leading software, training and certification companies: BEA Systems, CGS, IBM, \nProsoftTraining, SkillSoft, Sun Microsystems, and Thomson Prometric. jCert s motto summarizes its purpose: \nCertified Once, Recognized Everywhere . jCert aims to establish and promote standards for the certification \nof enterprise developers who use Java. The objective is to provide a ready supply of trained Java technology \ndevelopers to meet the increasing demand for enterprise applications in the e-commerce marketplace [12]. \nAs an organization, jCert does not own exams or curricula. Instead, it promotes a certification standard \ncomposed of industry-tested exams and curricula for generic Java and related technology skills. The jCert \nprogram recognizes four job roles [8]: Web Developer, Java Programmer, Solution Developer and Enterprise \nDeveloper. A job role is an industry-recognized job title that details the knowledge and practical skills \nrequired to perform specific job tasks. Each job role includes a series of certification exams owned \nand managed by various jCert member organizations. Candidates can qualify for jCert job roles bypassing \nthe specified certification exams. Two of the job roles, Web Developer and Java Programmer, are defined \nas core technologycertifications, meaning these exams validate vendor-neutral and Java-based technology \n(non-tool) skills. Currently three member organizations offer jCert core exams: CIW, IBM and Sun. Solution \nDeveloper and Enterprise Developer job-role certifications consist of core and vendor\u00adspecific exams. \nThe vendor exams build upon the vendor-neutral or \"common\" skills obtained in the core exams and require \nthe certification candidate to validate competency in a tool-specific environment. Currently, BEA, IBM \nand Sun develop, manage and deliver vendor exams included in the jCert Solution Developer and Enterprise \nDeveloper job roles. 3.4 SCJP: Sun Certified Java Programmer As seen in previous sections, there are \nseveral options to choose from when considering Java certification. We decided to go for Sun s programmer \ncertification because of its wide industry recognition, and also because it offers the mostflexible certification \nstart path for our students: they can later continue in whatever avenue they choose from Sun, ProsoftTraining \nor jCert (see figure 1). The current edition of the SCJP exam is based on the Java 2 platform, version \n1.4. In general, this exam is a fairly comprehensive examination of one s knowledge of the latest version \nof the Java programming language and of few key packages that belong to the Java standard library[14]. \nIt covers concepts, reserved words and language structures and capabilities as well as elements of the \nstandard Java programming environment. Some basic understanding of object-oriented design, development, \ntesting and implementation is absolutelyessential for prospective exam candidates. Specifically, these \nare the nine topics evaluated in this exam [13]: Declarations and access control.  Flow control, assertions, \nand exception handling.  Garbage collection.  Language fundamentals.  Operators and assignments. \n Overloading, overriding, runtime type and object orientation.  Threads.  Fundamental classes in the \njava.lang package.  The collections framework.  The previous version of the test (CX-310-025) is significantly \ndifferent from the current one (CX-310-035). The former is focused on the Java 2 platform, version 1.2, \nwhile the later is based in version 1.4. It s worthwhile highlighting the differences between both these \nexams because manyof the currently available resources (books, web sites, mock exams, etc.) are still \nfocused on the CX-310-025 exam. In the new exam, all AWT objectiveshave been removed. This means that \nthere are no questions on GUI programming. Also, all I/O objectives have been removed, and there is a \nnew objective on assertions. Lastly, a few of the previous objectives have been strengthened, including \nthose related to the hashcode and equals methods, the collection framework, and wrapper classes. The \nCX-310-035 SCJP exam may be taken in anyauthorized Prometric testing center. It s a multiple choice and \nshort answer exam, comprised of 61 questions that must be answered in 120 minutes or less. In order to \npass, candidates must correctly answer at least 32 of the 61 questions (52%). It has a cost of 150 US \ndollars.  4. JAVA CERTIFICATION WORKSHOP In the fall semester of 2002, our department offered a new \ncourse entitled Java Certification Workshop . The course was offered as an elective subject for senior \nComputer Science undergraduate students. The purpose was to prepare them to take the SCJPexam once the \nsemester concluded. At that time, we didn t know what to expect. We hoped that every enrolled student \ngot certified, but we weren t sure if this was realistic expectation. 4.1 Previous Student Experience \nA typical Computer Science senior student at our university usually arrives to our certification workshop \nwith a reasonable amount of previous Java experience. Aside form the CS1 course, most students have taken \nat least a couple of courses in which important software projects are developed using Java. These courses \nmight include, but are not limited to: Software Design, S u n M i cr os y s t e m s P r o s of t T r \na i n i n g j C e r t Su n Su n  Ma s t e r Ce r t i f i e d jC e r t jC e r t Ce r t i f i e \nd  CI W We b Sol u t i on En t e r p r i s e Ja v a  En t e r p r i s e Co m p o n t De v e l \no p e r De v e l o p e r De v e l o p e r  De v e l o p e r De v e l o p e r  S u n Cer t if ied \nJ a v a P r og r a m m er Figure 1: Certification options starting withSCJP Programming Languages, Component-Based \nComputing, Compiler Construction, Net-centric Computing, Advanced Operating Systems, Advanced Database \nSystems, Computer Graphics, and Intelligent Systems. Furthermore, some students might have used Java \nin a capstone project or in a community service project. The important thing to note here is that at \nthe beginning of the workshop, students already know how to program with Java. Thus, in the workshop \nwe are able to spend more time in those topics in which we know our students are usually weak. At first, \nit might seem unnecessary to a have a one semester workshop for students who already have a significant \namount of on-hands Java experience. But as many experts point out, even the best Java gurus can fail \nthis exam if they don t have an appropriate preparation. As Awe [2] affirms: Failing to prepare equals \npreparing to fail .  4.2 Grades One of the main distinctive features of this workshop, at least compared \nto other courses offered by our department, is that in order to pass the course the student must pass \nthe certification exam. 70 out of 100 points of the final course grade are awarded to students who obtain \na passing score in the SCJP exam. The other 30 points are attained from other preparation exams and activities. \nBecause the passing grade is 70 in our university, they have no alternatives but to get a passing score \nin the SCJP exam. Every student enrolled in the workshop is required to pay for her or his exam. We give \nsome assistance to our students so as to simplify their exam registration process (i.e. obtaining the \nexam voucher from Sun Educational Services and contacting a Prometric testing center). 4.3 Activities \nWe have devised several course activities for the entire semester in order to prepare our students for \nthe certification process: Weekly tests. From the start of the semester, we schedule a 15 to 20 minute \nwritten test at the end of every week, covering the content of a specific chapter of the textbook [10]. \nThe test has basically the same format as the SCJP exam. After the test has been taken, we go through \nthe exam with all the class in order to solve any questions.  Summary Notes. Although this exam preparation \ntechnique might sound pretty obvious, a surprisingly large number of senior students do not have the \ndiscipline to carry it out unless explicitly requested. Before the weekly test, they are required to \nread the corresponding textbook chapter and make awesome summary notes as described in [5]. Having students \nmake these kinds of notes has several advantages. First, it helps them organize and group the study material \nso as to understand better the relationships between different concepts. Furthermore, writing out and \norganizing the material on paper creates a visual cue, which makes is much easier to remember. At the \nend of the semester they have a compilation of the most important concepts of the textbook. These notes \ncan then be used for doing a quick recap the day before taking the SCJP exam, instead of having to skim \nthrough the whole textbook again.  Monthly exam. Our students take a 50-minute written exam at the \nend of every month. These exams have the same format as the SCJP exam, and they include all the material \ncovered so far in the semester. We only have three monthly exams in one semester. Because of its extent, \nthe last monthly exam can be considered a close simulation of the real exam.  Lectures. The most difficult \ntopics are reviewed in lecture sessions. As instructors we know which areas are typically challenging \nto our students. We also use the results of the weekly and monthly exams to adjust the content of our \nlectures. The workshop is carried out in a classroom that allows hands-on demonstrations on the topics \nbeing dealt with. The instructor has a projector connected to his laptop computer, and most students \nbring their own laptops as well. This allows testing and dissecting pieces of code in an interactive \nmanner.  Virtual forum. Every week or two, students are required to read a course related Web article. \nThe article themes have to do with certification and specific Java technology issues. After that, every \nstudent must post a message to the course s newsgroup with a comment or critique regarding the article. \nWe use this space to encourage group discussions on the positive and negative aspects of Java and certifications, \naccording to different authors. We believe that this activity is important, because it allows students \nto have a better thought perception of the virtues and limitations of Java certification. This is the \nmoment in which they should realize that a certification is no substitute for experience.  Programming \nexercises. The textbook includes some programming exercises at the end of every chapter, so that concepts \ncan be tried out in practice. Students are encouraged to do those and some other exercises provided by \nthe instructor.  Programming contests. During the semester we have three or four short programming contests. \nThe objective is let students apply some recently discussed material in order to solve small yet interesting \nprogramming problems. For this activity, students work in pairs.  Java Jeopardy. Five or six times during \nthe semester we organize a question and answer game similar to the Jeopardy! TV game. Students compete \nin teams of three or four people. There is a board with six columns and four rows  Ga r b a g e C o \nlle c t io n Th r e a d s E x pr essi o n s A n o n y m ous C l asses Re se r v e d Wo r d s Da ta Ty \np e s 200 200 200 200 200 200 400 400 400 400 400 400 600 600 600 600 600 600 800 800 800 800 800 \n800  Figure 2: Example of Java Jeopardy (see figure 2). Every column represents a question category, \nfor example declarations, expressions, control sequences, etc. The rows contain numbers that represent \ngame points. Each team in turn selects a category and the number of points they wish to play (higher \npoints means higher difficulty level). Given an answer statement, the team has to formulate what the \ncorresponding question should be. If the team makes a correct formulation, they win those points. The \nwinning team is the one that gets the largest amount of points at the end of the game. This is probably \nthe student s favorite activity. In a very fun and dynamic way, it allows quick reviews of the most important \nconcepts on any given topic. We can always take a couple of minutes from the game to explain a certain \nconcept if we see that most of the group is struggling with it.  5. CURRENT OUTCOME Our first workshop \ngeneration had twenty-two students. All of them took their SCJP exam during the months of November and \nDecember of 2002. Twenty-one of them obtained a passing score on their first try. Only one required a \nsecond chance to pass the exam. The second generation had twenty-eight students. They took the exam during \nthe months of May and June of 2003. Twenty-two of them passed the exam in their first try, four of them \nneeded a re\u00adtake in order to pass, and two desisted after failing their first attempt. Considering the \ntwo generations into account, 48 students have become certified Java programmers at the end of the course; \nthat s 96% of the students enrolled in the workshop. Immediately after a candidate completes the exam, \na report sheet is generated that includes the global result and an analysis for each section (topic). \nAlthough this information is intended as a feedback mechanism specifically for the exam candidate, it \ns actually more useful for us as instructors. Here are the results of both generations together (the \nright column is the group average): SCJP Score 70% Declarations and access control 70% Flow control, \nassertions, and exception handling 70% Garbage collection 56% Language fundamentals 77% Operators and \nassignments Overloading, overriding, runtime type and obj. orientation 71% 78% Threads 65% Fundamental \nclasses in the java.lang package 66% The collections framework 64% The four main sections in which we \ncan improve are quite clear from this table: garbage collection, the collections framework, fundamental \nclasses in the java.lang package, and threads. In the semester in progress (autumn 2003), we have twenty-four \nstudents enrolled in the Java Certification Workshop. With the experience we gained from the last two \nsemesters, we have some high expectations for this third generation. Our goal is to certify every single \nstudent, and we hope to increase the average score.  6. CONCLUSIONS We have clearly seen that Java certification \nallows students to get a deeper understanding of the Java language, in a way that otherwise just wouldn \nt happen. Although some students have a lot of experience using Java in other courses, there is always \na subset of the language that they ignore and therefore never use. The SCJP exam is not easy. It requires \nan economical investment, an important amount of time for preparation, and a great deal of personal motivation. \nIndeed it is a challenge to offer this certification in a regular university class environment with two\u00addozen \nstudents with dissimilar skills and experience. However, the series of activities that we have used in \nour workshop have given positive results. In a 16-week time frame, we can review every single section \nof the exam. At the end of the semester, there s no need for cramming, because our students have had \ntime to adequately digest all the material, so they can confidently go and take the exam. At the end, \nthe most rewarding moment is when you see a proud student s face filled with relief and satisfaction \nafter taking and passing the SCJP exam. Given the success and popularity of the Java certification workshop \namong students, our Computer Science department started offering this semester (autumn 2003) an other \nnew elective course entitled Web Component Developer Workshop , focused on preparing students for the \nSCWCD (Java Servlets and JSP) exam. Furthermore, our university has just joined the Sun Academic Initiative \n(SAI), which is a program designed by Sun Microsystems to bring technology education to the academic \nmarketplace. We are confident that these two initiatives will have an additional positive effect complementing \nour student s professional development. 7.
