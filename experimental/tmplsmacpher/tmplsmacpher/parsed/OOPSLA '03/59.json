Alleman Kent \nBeck Joe Blotner (Chair) CH2M Hill Three Rivers Institute Sabrix, Inc Sabrix, Inc. Ward Cunningham Mary \nPoppendieck Rebecca Wirfs-Brock Cunningham &#38; Cunningham Poppendieck, LLC Wirfs-Brock Associates ABSTRACT \nSelf-directed team is one of the mantras of Agile Methodologies. Self-direction means that the team s \nmanager is relegated to a facili\u00adtator role with little or no influence over day-to-day activities. For \nexample, Kent Beck has written that the manager of an XP project can do four things: ask for estimates \non cost and results, move peo\u00adple around among projects, ask for status reports, and cancel the project. \nAgile literature in general says that managers shouldn t be directly involved in analysis, design, coding, \ntesting or integration. They may (but only occasionally!) facilitate the process between the customer \nand the developers - and it would be nice if they provided food and toys to keep the team happy. It appears, \nthen, that the agile manger is expected to hover on the fringes of a project asking a few questions and \nthrowing in goodies but with ultimate power (can\u00adcellation) in her hip pocket. This scenario makes one \nwonder. Do managers really matter to the success of an agile project? Are they superfluous? What happens \nwhen managers step over the prescribed line does it mean that the end of Agile Methodology as we know \nit and as handed down by the Agile Manifesto? The panel will explore this ticklish terrain by answering \nthe following questions. Why Agile Methods and managers don t mix. Or do they?  What can/should managers \ndo in an agile environment?  Under what conditions are managers an absolute requirement in an agile \nenvironment? (e.g. Government applications?)  Do good management techniques apply to both Agile and \nnon-Agile environments?  Is management a dead-end profession in an Agile world?

Alleman, glen.alleman@rfets.gov An operational definition \nof the management role is the removal of impediments to progress. A typical set of functions performed \nby a manager includes: planning and budgeting, organizing and staffing, controlling and problem solving, \nand producing predictability, or\u00adder, and consistency. The environment for these activities is rarely \nfound in software development in the way intended by the author, John P. Kotter his book What Leaders \nReally Do. Kotter defines leadership as establishing a direction, aligning the people, motivat\u00ading and \ninspiring, and producing a dramatic useful change. In a software development environment based on agile \ndevelopment methods, the role played by a manager should be more closely aligned with those of a leader. \nKotter s manager roles are provided by the agile team, its self-directed leadership processes and the \nfully engaged customer. In this context the manager is outside the do\u00admain of the agile development team. \nIf the operational definition of management is taken to be Kotter s second set of activities, the role \nof management is critical to the success of the agile team. Not in the delivery of software, since that \ntakes place internal to the team, but in the role that moves the or\u00adganization forward in the deployment \nof agile development meth\u00adods. Following Kotter, the manager as leader must perform the following: establish \na sense of urgency, form a powerful guiding coalition, create a vision, communicate the vision, empower \nothers to act on the vision, plan for and create short-term wins, consolidate improvements and produce \nstill more change, and institutional\u00adize the new approaches. With this approach to management the agile \nteam can operate within its domain, while the external forces affecting its success become the domain \nof the manager. Glen Alleman is the Vice President for Program Management, CH2M HILL, Rocky Flats Environment \nTechnology Site, Golden Colorado. CH2M HILL provides Information Technology services in support of the \nclosure of the former nuclear weapons plant at Rocky Flats. In this capacity, Glen directs a staff of \nproject manag\u00aders, administrators, and accountants in the delivery of program man\u00adagement services for \nsoftware development, telecommunications, networking, and server operations for the Rocky Flats site. \nPrior to CH2M HILL, Glen was the Chief Technology Officer of Niwot Ridge Consulting specializing in enterprise \napplication integration, system architecture, business process improvement, and project management applied \nto manufacturing, electric utility, petrochemi\u00adcal, aerospace, process control, publishing, and pharmaceutical \nin\u00addustries. 3. Kent Beck, kent@threeriversinstitute.org Diana Mekelburg describes three axes of project \nexpectations: Product - what features are in the product  Business - what business effects you expect \nto see from a product with the expected features  Conduct - what behavior the rest of the organization \nexpects from a well-run project.  The first two sets of expectations are manageable for the team. Pre\u00adsenting \na reassuring and honest face from a project that is running internally quite different from the rest \nof the organization is a job requiring nerve, perspective, communication, contacts and creativ\u00adity. In \nother words, the same skills that get managers made into managers. Ordinary internal operations on an \nExtreme Programming team do not require management intervention. Daily business is covered by the team \ns rules, but more importantly the social contract implicit in the rules. Extraordinary events and foreign \nrelations, though, are inevitable and an absolutely appropriate venue for the exercise of of managerial \nresponsibility, or, as we geeks say, Do some of that manager stuff Kent Beck is the founder and director \nof TRI. He has pioneered patterns for software development, the xUnit family of testing frameworks, the \nHotDraw drawing editor framework, CRC cards, refactoring, and most recently Extreme Programming. He is \nthe author of Extreme Programming Explained, Planning Extreme Programming, and The Smalltalk Best Practice \nPatterns. He lives on 20 acres in rural southern Oregon with his wife, five children (one sadly now gone \nto college), four dogs, two sheep, and a vari\u00adable number of domestic fowl.  4. Joe Blotner, joeb@sabrix.com \nOne of the myths of Agile Development is that self-organizing teams do not need direction. The agile \ndevelopment movement fo\u00adcuses primarily on programmers programmers should do X, Y and Z, and everyone \nelse should do whatever it takes to support the pro\u00adgrammers. A fantastic start, since programmers are \nthe people who actually build the organization s product; however, few techniques are offered to the \nrest of the organization. The admonishment to managers instructing them to only provide toys and food \nand buffer the team from external distractions im\u00adplies that leaders in an agile environment should do \nless work, and be less involved with the team on a day-to-day basis, than in a more traditional environment. \nIn fact a leader in an agile group must do more than he/she would in a more traditional environment and \nmust be even more involved in the day-to-day activities of the team. I assert that management best practices, \nwhen applied appropriately and discerningly, do not limit, but rather enhance, the productivity and job \nsatisfaction of the individual members of the Engineering team, and improve the end product in the process. \nA good manager can and should help the team be more productive, have a better understanding of their \nfit in the organization as a whole and develop team members by being active and involved with the team \nand the rest of the company. Joe Blotner has been involved in building software since 1996, as an engineer \nand a manager (in most cases, at the same time). He has performed these tasks for Timberline Software, \nTektronix, Xerox and MeasureCast. In these organizations, he has worked in Water\u00adfall, Iterative and \nExtreme Programming(TM) environments. He is currently in the trenches as the Senior Engineering Manager \nat Sa\u00adbrix, Inc., a start-up software company delivering enterprise class transaction tax software to \nGlobal2000 customers. At Sabrix he reined in the chaos by developing and implementing a unique Agile \ndevelopment methodology as reported in his experience report Ag\u00adile Techniques to Avoid Firefighting \nat a Start-Up , presented at OOPSLA 2002. He started out his adult life as a stage actor, which dovetails \nnicely with his management career. 5. Ward Cunningham, ward@c2.com There is more to management than \nhanding out assignments and taking notes in the weekly status meeting. That more is the part that remains \nwhen you adopt an agile method. Extreme programming, for example, says nothing about capital purchase \napproval or salary administration, but that doesn t make these downward looking responsibilities go away. \nThere are also upward looking responsi\u00adbilities such as budgeting and strategic planning that are probably \nbest if shouldered by an individual. Still agile teams take time-consuming management activities and \nmake them their own. That means a manager does more oversight than day-to-day managing of the programming \nactivities. Can we therefore expect the role to change? Certainly. Every XP value: communication, simplicity, \nfeedback and courage, suggests possi\u00adbilities for the role. Can paired managing be far behind? Ward Cunningham \nis a founder of Cunningham &#38; Cunningham, Inc. He has served as Director of R&#38;D at Wyatt Software \nand as Principle Engineer in the Tektronix Computer Research Laboratory. Ward is well known for his contributions \nto the developing practice of object-oriented programming, the variation called Extreme Pro\u00adgramming, \nand the communities hosted by his WikiWikiWeb. He is active with the Hillside Group and has served as \nprogram chair of the Pattern Languages of Programs conference which it sponsors. 6. Mary Poppendieck, \nmary@poppendieck.com Sports teams have coaches. Orchestras have conductors. Even jazz bands have leaders. \nNote: sporting teams also have managers, so do orchestras, and often jazz bands do too. The manager is \nthe one who sees to the administrative tasks of the organization, while the coach, concoctor, or leader \nsees to coordinating the team or orchestra or band. Coaches and conductors do not play with the team \nor band, but they know the sport or the music very well, and their job is to organize the group so it \ncan perform at its best. Software development teams need leaders who set direction, align people, obtain \nresources, coordinate efforts, run interference, and provide a motivating environment. New team members \nneed to be recruited and trained. Standards must be set and various areas of expertise require nurturing. \nIn complex systems, expert designers are important; if they are not appointed, they will emerge. Teams \nappreciate good leadership, because it helps them be suc\u00adcessful. I distinguish management tasks getting \nthe maximum value from the dollar from leadership tasks helping people to excel. Leaders are required. \nManagers are optional.

Her book Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit brings lean thinking to software development. \n6.1 Rebecca Wirfs-Brock, rebecca@wirfs-brock.com I ve always done what s needed. I don t like to be pigeonholed \nas just being good at one thing. So as an engineer I ve happily planned, documented (gasp), and made \ntough choices. Coding or design for me has never been the end goal just the fun part. Satisfying com\u00adplex \nproblem within a limited time, budget, and with changing cus\u00adtomer needs is the real goal. I ve also \nhad the title of software manager. Even in those jobs I jumped in and did what was needed. It startled \npeople that I would write and read code, and wanted to weigh in on design alternatives. You might not \nhave liked me as your manager. But as a manager, I had added responsibilities that were never officially \npart of my non\u00admanagerial jobs. People and political and organizations issues were front and center. \nAccountability and getting the group to gel were my responsibilities. So while I d like it if everyone \nwould just as\u00adsume the right attitude, play well together, and do what s best, I believe there is an \nimportant role for managers in an agile world. In this agile world, I think there are even more managerial \nchallenges. As a manager, you can t just follow a standard recipe for success you must adapt, reflect, \nand lead by example.
