Yavari Graduate Student 2834 Malabar Ave, Apt. #3 \nSanta Clara, CA, 95051 408-244-9600 e_yavari@yahoo.com  ABSTRACT Selection of proper analysis and design \nmethods is crucial to produce cost and time efficient applications. Effective strategies help developers \nto come up with more stable, reusable, and complete applications, which is the main purpose of software \nmanagement. In order to express the importance of proper analysis and design methods, this poster compares \ntwo different modeling methods: traditional object oriented and software stability. The modeling methods \nare utilized for development of the same application: MRI visual analyzer (MRIVA). MRIVA is a computer \napplication to help doctors gain a better understanding of Magnetic resonance image (MRI) pictures. It \nprovides them the opportunity to access variant parts of the organ and study it from different points \nof view. The current poster shows the result of both methods; however, it is evident that SSM model is \nsimpler and more complete. It offers a firm base for later reuses and is stable under changes over time \nor application area.

INTRODUCTION The concepts of enduring business themes (EBT) and business objects \n(BO) have been introduced as a proposed solution to the current problems in the software management area \ndue to the increasing costs to adopt, scale, modify, or customize the applications. The idea is to identify \nthe aspects of the environment in which the software will operate that are stable over the time and application \ndomains. Answering the core questions: What is the system for? , What does it do? , and What does it \nneed to meet the goals? , are very helpful to find the proper classes. Since this core knowledge is stable \nand lasting, changes introduced to the software project will be in the periphery [1,2]. In this case \nstudy, we will introduce a problem statement: MRI Visual Analyzer. We provide two distinct design models \nfor the same application. The first one is done considering traditional object oriented modeling, while \nthe second one follows the guidelines of software stability modeling. One can see the outstanding superiority \nof SSM in any context such as scalability, completeness, simplicity, and so on [5,6]. Copyright is held \nby the author/owner(s).

MRI VISUAL ANALYZER The magnetic Resonance \nImaging (MRI) system provides two\u00addimensional (2D) images of organs in the nervous system. Each image \nshows a horizontal picture of a particular height. Any issue in the organ would be presented in several \nconsecutive pictures. So the problem will be found by studying all of the pictures carefully. Sometimes \ndoctors need to do more processing on the images (for example coloring or removing specific layers) to \nallow a better distinction between the cells with different levels of magnetic resonance. These processes \nare mostly time consuming and expensive. The problem is to design and implement an accurate, fast, effective, \nand easy-to-use application for MRI visual analysis that performs all required processes and saves the \nresults so they are always available to be discussed and/or reviewed by the medical professionals. The \napplication should enable doctors to see the results of a MRI as three-dimensional objects. Putting the \ninformation of all horizontal slices together and merging them into a space object will make the three-dimensional \nview. (See Figure 1) Figure 1-Merging horizontal slices into a space object MRIVA system will also \nprovide the opportunity to access various parts of the organ and study it from different points of view. \nIt will be done with another feature that slices the 3D object There are more features such as measurement, \nopacity, rotation and coloring that make the application useful by achieving a more precise, fast, effective, \nand easy to understand vision of the organ s cells.

It mainly concentrates on \nthe classes derived from the problem statement. It is incomplete, complicated, hard to reuse and change, \nand inscaleable as you see [5,6].
