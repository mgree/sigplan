The purpose of the group is to communicate corporate requirements to vendors and \nconsortia. In addition, the group will provide a mechanism for sharing experiences and lessons learned \nin introducing object technology into large corporations. A possible motto for the group is: Object-oriented \nTechnology + Business Case + Migration Plan = Success . One of the first activities of the group will \nbe trying to organize a Smalltalk workshop in the Pacific Northwest around the time of OOPSLA 1992. To \nget on the group s mailing list contact Bob Marcus at (X)6)865-3189 or rmarcus@atc.boeing.com . As part \nof the initial meeting, a list of end-user requirements for vendors was gathered by brainstorming. These \nare: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.  Consider your products as components of larger and/or legacy systems. Focus \non areas where your product can add value. Avoid unnecessary proprietary features and interfaces. Interoperate \nwith other products and components. Plan to interface with multiple legacy platforms, systems, processes \nand organizations. Supply tools for supporting total life cycle project management, methodologies and \nmetrics. Provide robust class libraries to encapsulate non-object-oriented systems. Supply tools for \nreverse engineering and code generation Provide object-oriented screen painters and robust standardized \nclasses for graphical user interfaces. 10. Supply source code for class libraries using a reasonable, \ncoherent pricing structure.
