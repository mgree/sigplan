To specify a process, we give an EPTL formula that describes its sequence of communications. The synthesis is done by constructing a model of the given specifications using a tableau-like satisfiability algorithm for the extended temporal logic. This model can then be interpreted as a program.", "authors": [{"name": "Pierre Wolper", "author_profile_id": "81100141337", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "person_id": "PP39029432", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/582153.582156", "year": "1982", "article_id": "582156", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Specification and synthesis of communicating processes using an extended temporal logic: (preliminary version)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=582156"}
