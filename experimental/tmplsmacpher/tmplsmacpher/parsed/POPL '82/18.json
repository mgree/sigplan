Such editors represent programs as attributed trees, which are modified by operations such as subtree pruning and grafting. After each modification, a subset of attributes, AFFECTED, requires new values. Membership in AFFECTED is not known a priori; this paper presents an algorithm that identifies attributes in AFFECTED and computes their new values. The algorithm is time-optimal, its cost is proportional to the size of AFFECTED.", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas Reps", "author_profile_id": "81100117392", "affiliation": "Cornell University, Ithaca, NY", "person_id": "PP40023877", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/582153.582172", "year": "1982", "article_id": "582172", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Optimal-time incremental semantic analysis for syntax-directed editors", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=582172"}
