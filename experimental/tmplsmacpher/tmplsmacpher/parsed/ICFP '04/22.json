This went well, except that our business lacked focus. \nEvery new job had to be found and sold from scratch. We realized that we had to focus on a specific market \nif we wanted to achieve stability and growth. We chose High Assurance Software as it was a natural fit \nboth for our technology and our expertise, further narrowing our attention to information assurance (IA). \nWhy IA? Because there are challenging assurance requirements here for which functional languages and \nother semantics-based techniques can be very relevant, especially in the handling of information that \ncross security classification boundaries. Currently there are very few systems that are trusted enough \nto span from unclassified to secret, so many US government employees have to have two or three separate \ncomputers on their desk, each connected to totally disconnected networks that each exist at a single \nclassification level. Information is kept separate by air gaps and sometimes it doesn t get through \nto the people who need it. To be permitted to span multiple classification domains, a system must satisfy \nmany stringent engineering and assurance requirements, including the application of formal and semi-formal \ntechniques. The challenges we had to confront in maturing Galois as a company such as the need for focus, \nand the importance of brand, for example provide powerful lessons that may be relevant to the broader \nfunctional language community as it continues to seek wider acceptance of its tools and technology. Bio \nJohn Launchbury is a founder and CEO of Galois Connection Inc. His business interest is to lead a world-class \norganization that is able routinely to deliver high-assurance software to clients, addressing the many \ncomplexities that arise in practice. In his other life he is a Professor in Computer Science, on entrepreneurial \nleave from the OGI School of Science and Technology at OHSU. John gained his Ph.D. from Glasgow University, \nwinning the British Distinguished Dissertation prize. John s primary technical interest has been in the \ndevelopment of functional programming, focusing especially on semantics and semantic-based transformations. \nCopyright is held by the author/owner(s).
