For 15 years, Ericsson has conducted experiments with \nErlang in an industrial setting, and for 12 years, actual commercial products have been developed. This \ntalk summarizes some of the lessons learned from this work. It is well known that it is difficult to \nintroduce a new programming technology. Even so, engineers often fail to realize that the reasons for \nresisting change are more often social/political than technical, even though the objections may seem \ntechnical in nature. This talk will highlight a few of the common objections to Erlang, and measure them \nagainst practical experience. In addition, it will suggest some topics for research that could result \nin significant cost savings in the near future, as well as inspire closer cooperation between industry \nand academia. Bio Ulf Wiger is a Senior Software Architect in the IP Connectivity and Control Nodes Department \nat Ericsson AB. He was Chief Designer of the Ericsson AXD 301 Multi-Service Gateway, a key component \nin Ericsson s market-leading Packet-based Telephony solution. With more than 2 million lines of Erlang \ncode, AXD 301 is one of the largest systems ever written in a functional language; with better than 99,999% \nservice availability around the clock, it is one of the most robust, and with more than 1,000 systems \ndelivered to all continents and a position as market leader, it is also one of the most commercially \nsuccessful.
