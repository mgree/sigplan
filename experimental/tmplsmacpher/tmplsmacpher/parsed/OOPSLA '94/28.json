The objective of this panel is to better understand the \nimplications the choice of database technology has on the application developer using objects. Differentiating \nbetween the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches -- relational (RDBMS), extended-relational \nand object (ODBMS) --can be a confusing task. The situation is becoming more complex as the technologies \nevolve to leverage each other s strengths. Some RDBMSs are beginning to support some aspects of object \ntechnology and some ODBMSs are now supporting SQL query capabilities and interfaces. Each panelist has \nbeen asked to describe a typical success story with his favorite technology, be it relational, extended-relational \nor object database. Preferably the situation will be one where a customer abandoned one of the technologies \nand moved to successful deployment with the panelist s advocated approach. The characteristics of these \nsituations should lead to better understanding of when it is appropriate to use each type of DBMS with \nobjects. The panel presentations will start with discussion of situations appropriate for the RDBMS approach, \nthen proceed to the extended-relational approach, and end with the use of ODBMSs. Jacob Stein (Strategic \nPlanning Manager, Sybase) While the choice of an ODBMS is appealing to application developers using \nan object programming language, this choice is often of limited applicability. In particular, ODBMS solutions \nare often limited to a single language, to single-application environments, to environments not requiring \nmultiple views of data (i.e., three-level architecture support), to client-centric applications that \ndo not require traditional server-side suppa and to departmental environments not requiring sophisticated \ndatabase administration. Object gateways to RDBMSs are often the best solution for developers in multiple-language, \nmultiple-tool or multiple-application scenarios, that must serve large numbers of users in integrated \ncorporate environments. RDBMS is often the only solution in very large database applications, or in situations \nrequiring access to and preservation of existing data already in relational systems. Background Dr. Stein \ns responsibilities include oversight of Sybase s object technology and tools initiatives. He has been \ninvolved in the research, development, marketing and application of object technology for over a decade. \nAt Servio, developer of the Gemstone ODBMS, Jacob held several positions, including Chief Technologist \nand Director of Marketing. He represents Sybase (and represented Servio) at the Object Management Group \n(OMG) and the Object Database Management Group (ODMG). Dr. Stein received his Ph.D. from the State University \nof New York at Stony Brook, where he worked with Dr. David Maier on object extensions to the relational \nmodel.  Jnan Dash (Vice President Product Strategy and Technology, Oracle Corp.) An evolutionary approach \ntowards a rapprochement of relational and object technologies is what Oracle envisions for the future. \nThe advantages of relational technologies (for example, non-navigational access, query optimization, \nlessons learnt in performance, concurrency control and distribution) must be combined with the power \nof object technology (including ADTs and the encapsulation of data and behavior in one abstraction). \nMore importantly, the DBMS by itself is only a partial solution. The entire 371 spectrum of GUI-objects \nto stored-objects must be addressed. Object storage, manipulation and distribution must be complemented \nwith object definition, modeling and assembly. Tools must span client-side end-users (for example with \nOLE2 and VBx) to enterprise levels for analysis, design, modeling and worktlow. Background Jnan Dash \nis responsible for product planning and architecture at Oracle. Prior to joining Oracle in 1992, Mr. \nDash was with IBM for 16 years, mostly at the Santa Teresa Lab in San Jose. He was in the original DB2 \ndevelopment team and was the original planner and architect of OS/2 Database Manager. Jnan speaks frequently \nat industry events on database technology.  Michael Stonebraker (Chief Technology Officer, Illustra \nInformation Technologies) Illustra is the leading example of an object-relational DBMS: a database that \ncan be extended with user-defined data types and functions. Using Illustra, customers can develop applications \nthat use SQL to query and manipulate complex data such as time series. This talk will focus on a Wall \nStreet risk management application utilizing complex queries against time-series data; an application \nthat proved impossible to build using an RDBMS. Background Dr. Michael Stonebraker is co-founder, chief \ntechnology officer and member of the Board of Directors of Illustra Information Technologies, Inc. A \nnoted expert in DBMSs, operating systems and expert systems, Dr. Stonebraker is professor of Electrical \nEngineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, where he joined the faculty \nin 1971. Illustm represents the commercialization of his U.C. Berkeley POSTGRES research project, which \nis one of the most advanced database research projects ever undertaken. He received a B.S. from Princeton \nUniversity and M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan.  Thomas Atwood (Chairman, Object Design) \nODBMS initially took hold in engineering and technical applications. Now ODBMSs are moving rapidly into \nsegments of the mainstream commercial market: telecommunications, utilities, and financial services. \nFortune 1000 firms are moving to modem client-server hardware configurations, at the same time as they \nare moving to modem object software development environments. This transition is at a half- way point \ntoday. Firms have moved to objects for their GUI and their programming environments, but are still translating \nobject schemas into relational tables for data storage. The next step is to replace the RDBMS with an \nODBMS, giving a uniform object environment from the front-end to the back-end. Mr. Atwood s comments \nwill focus on a particular application written in an object 4GL, and will compare the process of mapping \nits objects to and from a set of relational tables, versus storing them directly as objects in an ODBMS. \nBackground Thomas Atwood is founder of Object Design, Inc., one of the leading players in the new generation \nof ODBMS firms. In addition to contributing significantly to the development and marketing of the firm \ns ODBMS product ObjectStore, he has assembled a high-powered set of partners for ODI. Recent investors \ninclude IBM, AT&#38;T and Intel. Earlier this year he set up a new business unit of ODI to develop 4GL \nand Smalltalk bindings for ObjectStore. These bindings will allow ODI to capitalize on the strong interest \nin object-oriented programming emerging within Fortune 1000 firms. Mr. Atwood is also a Director of the \nObject Data Management Group (ODMG), which in Ql of this year introduced its first draft standard for \nODBMSs. 372  \n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "191080", "abstract": "", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas Atwood", "author_profile_id": "81100571496", "affiliation": "Object Design", "person_id": "P280237", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jnan Dash", "author_profile_id": "81100440595", "affiliation": "Oracle", "person_id": "P141228", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jacob Stein", "author_profile_id": "81100214026", "affiliation": "Sybase", "person_id": "PP31098112", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Michael Stonebraker", "author_profile_id": "81337493529", "affiliation": "Illustra", "person_id": "PP43134090", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Mary Loomis", "author_profile_id": "81100091003", "affiliation": "Hewlett-Packard Labs", "person_id": "PP39079945", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/191080.191138", "year": "1994", "article_id": "191138", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Objects and databases (panel)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=191138"}
