Workshop Report Steven Fraser -BNR Ltd - Facilitator \n(sdfi-aser@bnr.ca) Bill Caster -C-Quad, Terry Cherry, Honna Segel -BNR Ltd. This workshop brought together \nparticipants to discuss and debate issues related to teams and objects. Like the OOPSLA 92 workshop Team \nApproaches to Object Design and the OOPSLA 93 workshop Design Trade-offs, the workshop was devoted to \na facilitated interaction between the participants to discover and share information and to build consensus. \nParticipants expressed their expectations as: learning from the experience of others; identifying common \nthemes for effective team structure; and understanding how to make large teams as effective as small \nteams These expectations were satisfied for the majority of participants. One surprise for most participants \nwas the lack of 00 specific-influences. There was general agreement that the ideal team: was small; possessed \nmembers with appropriate cross-functional skills; had good communication bandwidth (both inter and intra); \nand was empowered by a seamless integrated toolset. Common themes were identified for the development \nof good team, these included: a reduced communications overhead; a small team size; a balanced low level \ndecision making capability with shared team vision; a common tool platform used by the team; and the \nearly development of a shared architecture. Team of Teams Discussion The second half of the workshop \nwas occupied with the development of models to describe a variety of team approaches. A broad consensus \nwas not achieved on any one of the proposed models - discussions continue! The three models developed \nby the workshop were: Potato model Reverse pyramid model Soft team model The next two sections identify \nsome aspects of current team reality, both positive and negative (no prioritization was attempted).
