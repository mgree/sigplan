To facilitate the successful adoption of obJect technology, a number of organizations have \nset up ObJect Technology Centers (OTCs). These workshops have been developed to provide members of such \norganizations a forum to discuss their respective efforts to establish OTCs and techniques they use in \ndriving the effective use of object technology in their organizations. 2.0 ORGANIZERS This workshop \nwas organized and run by: Vijay Vaishnavi (Georgia State and COMSOFT, cisvkv@gsusgi2.gsu.edu) Tom Kristek \n(IBM, scuba@pkedvm9.vnet.ibm.com) Tim Korson (COMSOFT, korson@comsoft.southem.edu) Neil Thomson (BNR, \nneilt@bnr.ca) Tom Guinane (IBM, guinane@vnet.ibm.com)  3.0 PARTICIPANTS In addition to the organizers \nlisted above, the followmg people participated in the workshop.

Portland, OR October \n23-27, 1994 Vijay reviewed the list of typical OTC activities . developed at last year s workshop, and \nto be the basis for each OTC s present&#38;Ion on its experiences. 5.0 REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES OF OTC s \n-moderated by Tim Korson Each participating OTC was asked to discuss their activities. They used the \nlist of typical OTC activities! developed at lastyear s workshop as a guide in these discussions. The \nfollowing matnx summarizes the activities of all participating OTC s, In the Matrix, the entries have \nthe following meaning: P : a primary activity of this OTC S : a secondary activity of this OTC -: not \nan activity of this OTC The Key for the companies listed across the top is: IBM = International Business \nMachines BNR = Bell Northern Research BOE = Boeing EDS = Electronic Data Systems JPM = JP Morgan ITT \n= ITT Hartford Insurance LOF = Libbey-Owens-Ford UoL = University of Lmz MM = Martin Marietta TI = Texas \nInstruments TRV = The Travelers TnRlc~ 1 CITC WORKGRnITP-nFFlNF.n flTC ACTTVTTTES *-..---. -^ -,. -~--u-~vv~ \n----_.--v-V _--_-.----- Justify Object Technology P s P - P PP s - s- Center Addendum tu the Proceedings \nOOPSLA 94 romote company activities externally Lobbying for support of P -P s s SP P s s-technology \nThere has not been time, to scientifically analyze what this means, but, viewing this matrix leads to \na few basic conclusions: -There are at least two major groupings of OTCs: those focusing on educating \nand technology transfer and those focusing on infrastructure and providing reusable entities. -Mentoring \nIS a critical offering of a majonty of technology centers.  6.0 PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS ON FOUR \nKEY TOPICS 6.1 MENTORING -moderated by Tom Kristek 61.1 IBM Approach to Mentoring - presented by Geoff \nHambrick IBM OOTC s top five recommendations for OTCs wishing to be successful with mentoring are: 1) \nDrive mentoring approach from real work products 2) Get management team involved early 3) Clearly establish \nmentor roles and responsibilities 4) Provide documented tools, techniques, and rules of thumb 5) Document \nand evaluate mentoring process Conversely, the top three things to avoid in establishing a mentoring \nbusiness are: 1) Subjective arguments between mentors 2) Mentoring faster than the project team can \nassimilate the information 3) Painting an unrealistic picture of the technology without discussmg costs \nand risks 6.1.2 The .IP Morgan approach to mentoring -presented by Laura Hill JP Morgan s top four things \nto do in establishing a mentormg busmess are: 1) Make a contract with the prodect team 2) Keep an ongoing \ntraming program 3) Allow object center personnel to perform multiple functions 4) Accept apprentice \nmentors JP Morgan s top two things to avoid in establishing a mentoring business are: 1) Don t confuse \na mentor s role with that of an internal cousultant 2) Don t be seen as an elitist organization 6.1.3 \nDiscussion Meutoring teams must lead by example, not being afraid to engage with the project team to \nget their hands dirty . Portland, OR October W-27,1994 Flexibility to handle non-optimal project attributes \nis essential. As different organizations raise their level of competency, the mentor team s interaction \nwith them will evolve into a more advisory role. Even within the life of a project, the needs of the \nteam evolve and the mentoring needs to change along with the needs. The OTC is typically faced with the \nproblem of a small team attempting to transfer Object Technology (OT) to a mass of people. Seeding teams \nwith educated, energetic leaders will increase their chances for success The OTC must strive to keep \nexpectations for what OT can do and how fast it can do it at reasonable levels. Mentoring should be a \ntwo-way street; educating the project and learning from them at the same time.  6.2 FRAMEWORKS AND \nREUSE -moderated by Tim Korson 6.2.1 Boeing view offrameworks and reuse -presented by Bob Marcus Ths \nBoeing view is that mentoring in OT is not suffic ent for an OTC. OTCs must move beyond that into supplying \nframeworks for projects to use and these frameworks must interface to existing non-00 environments, The \nOTCs must work actively with application development projects to develop and evolve these frameworks. \nThe role of the Boeing OTC will be to sort through emerging frameworks such as Taligent trying to determine \nwhat best applies to their business. The emphasis will be on using and evolving existing frameworks rather \nthan building their own. 6.2.2 TI view of frameworks and reuse -presented by Bob Hodges The TI recommendations \nfor being successful in this area are to: 1) Build applications through frameworks 2) Abstract generic \npieces and patterns into frameworks 3) Iterate frequently to improve the framework 4) Fan expertise \non building and using frameworks to other teams The TI lists of impediments to success when addressing \nreuse and frameworks are: 1) The very difficult Not Invented Here! syndrome 2) The continued rewards \nfor creation of parts rather than the use of parts 3) Tools for effectively supporting reuse are not \nyet available 6.2.3 Discussion Re-engineering and modeling the enterprise needs to be an iterative process \nsimilar to the process recommended for technical development projects. The iterative process has sequential \nphases (requirements, analysis, design, etc.) that are executed in much smaller increments than m the \nusual development process This can be applied to technical projects and business re-engineering. An OTC \nshould be providing knowledgeable assistance for project decisions in the development and use of frameworks. \n 6.3 CHALLENGES OF RAPID OT DEPLOYMENT -moderated by Neil Thomson 6.3.1 BNR view of Rapid Deployment \n-presented by Rick Johnson The lessons that the BNR OC would pass on to others charged with rapidly deploying \nOT in their corporation are: 1) To establish partnerships with key customers 2) To focus on accomplishing \ntangible items 3) Try out new methods, approaches, and techniques with pilot projects with relatively \nshort turn-around time 4) To roll out offerings in phases. Project teams will not be able to assimilate \nlarge chunks of information rapidly Some problems to avoid in order to ensure effectiveness are: 1) Avoid \nan unclear mandate. The mission needs to be clear within the OC and in the user commumty 2) Avoid not \nhaving concrete deliverables. Need a good plan for showing value of mentoring 6.R2 ITT Hartford view \nof rapid deployment -presented by Dave Labas Based on their experiences, The Hartford offered these thoughts \non the contributors to successful, rapid transfer of object technology: 1) Recognize that you cannot \nachieve business goals without doing something different. This implies an acceptance of risk 2) You need \nexpertise to drive and facilitate the transition to the new technology. These people must be talented, \nmulti-faceted, and very motivated 3) Start out with a pilot project to prove your concept and show and \nshow results 4) Get management buy-in for a central support organization 5) Tailor different sales pitches \non the benefits of the technology to the specific audience. Business people have different interests \nthan management who have different interests than technical people Possible pitfalls to be wary of in \ntrying to rapidly deploy technology include: 1) Initial confusion about what to invest in up front. You \nneed to make some basic decisions and keep focused on moving forward 2) Not preparing for success. You \nneed to manage expectations but also manage for, and prepare to achieve, success. Have plans in place \non dealing with increased interest in services as success is shown 3) Tension may exist between OTC and \ncreative OT developers. Be prepared to deal with this. Must learn how to balance creativity with business \ngoals 4) Middle management could be a road block. Get their buy-in early through education  6.3.3 Discussion \nSuccess in bringing middle management along with the deployment of the technology is a must. One approach \nis to collect metrics in early iterations of a project and help middle management to understand how to \nuse these to project how the rest of the project will unfold. Develop use cases and dole out class development \nwith the provision that people create the classes in order to solve the use case needs. Then, at any \ncheckpoint you will have real working code for at least some part of the system s functional requirements. \nDevelop, understand, and follow guidelines for picking initial OT projects. Some possible guidelines \ninclude not picking something too easy. The initial projects should be indicative of what the organization \nreally does. The project should be average and reflect the average skills of the development groups (putting \nall OT experts on a project would likely be slightly misleading). Encourage teams that want to do this \nand discourage teams that clearly have little chance for success. Sometimes bad news is a more important \ndeliverable than technology transfer.  6.4 TECHNOLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS -moderated by Vijay Vaishnavi \n 6.4. I IBM view of technology recommendations - presented by Tom Guinane IBM s recommendations for dealing \nwith this topic effectively: 1) Documents must be grounded in expertise and enhanced as experience grows \n2) Recommendations must be strong, clear, and concise 3) Audiences must be targeted appropriately and \nutilize external pre-release reviews to ensure usefulness 4) Assign one author but utilize the entire \nteam in review cycles Portland, OR October 23-27,1994 5) Target documents as a paper mentor providing \n7.0 OPEN DISCUSSION -moderated by Tom guidance across the life-cycle Kristek Things to avoid when producing \ndocumentation include: 1) Do&#38; wait for perfection. Put out what you know now. It is likely to be \nmore than your users know and of value to them 2) Don t let documents get old. Iterate frequently and \nincorporate experienced-based knowledge 3) Avoid being too subjective. Establish fact-based selection \ncriteria for evaluation-type documents. But, don t automatically avoid a good controversy 6.4.2 Martin \nMarietta s view of technology recommendations - presented by Dave Richards Recommendations from Martin \nMarietta for being successful with this topic 1) Document your processes 2) Provide process checklists \nto ensure completeness 3) Concentrate on your process not on a specific methodology 4) Anticipate users \nquestions j) Develop document templates and style guides 6) Seek to use soft copy models as delivered \ndocumentation 7) Make sure you target your audience One thing to avoid is: 1) Voluminous or ornately \ndetailed documents, but they must have some content to be useful  6.4.4 Discussion OTC members have \nlearned from reading. Users will expect a combination of reading and mentoring as part of their learning \nprocess. Utilize paper as the arbitrator; once an argument is documented, pass it around for sanity checking \nand agreement. Paul Richards from EDS wanted to take an informal survey. Eight of the companies were \npresent when he did so. The basic premise of this was to ask how many companies were dealing with a particular \ntopic in a particular way. Paul wanted the data to help him sell some of his plans for the EDS OTC. 1. \nEnterprise models: In house models-5, Models for customers -1 2.

Additionally, Tim and Vijay are editing a book \non OTCs. The book will contain chapters on four-to-six OTCs and an introduction. COMSOFT is also planning \na two day conference in April in Atlanta which would basically be an extended workshop for OTCs. The \nintent would be to allow new OTCs to gain from the experience of established OTCs, while also addressing \ntechnology issues such as testing, management, etc. COMSOFT will also plan on establishing a way for \nOTCs to communicate with each other between formal workshops.    \n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "260028", "abstract": "", "authors": [{"name": "Tom Kristek", "author_profile_id": "81100391886", "affiliation": "IBM", "person_id": "P283574", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Vijay Vaishnavi", "author_profile_id": "81100538659", "affiliation": "Georgia State University & COMSOFT", "person_id": "P291154", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/260028.260119", "year": "1994", "article_id": "260119", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Role of a corporate object technology center", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=260119"}
