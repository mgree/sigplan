BRSs represent a wide variety of calculi for mobility, including &#955;-calculus and ambient calculus. A labelled transition system (LTS) for each BRS is here derived uniformly, adapting previous work of Leifer and Milner, so that under certain conditions the resulting bisimilarity is automatically a congruence. For an asynchronous &#955;-calculus, this LTS and its bisimilarity agree closely with the standard.", "authors": [{"name": "Ole H&#248;gh Jensen", "author_profile_id": "81540539856", "affiliation": "Aalborg University, Denmark", "person_id": "P414186", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Robin Milner", "author_profile_id": "81332515695", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge, UK", "person_id": "PP43124678", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/604131.604135", "year": "2003", "article_id": "604135", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Bigraphs and transitions", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=604135"}
