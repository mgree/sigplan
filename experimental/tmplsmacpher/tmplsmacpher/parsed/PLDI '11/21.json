Replaying a long execution is time consuming, especially when replay is further integrated with runtime techniques that require expensive instrumentation, such as dependence detection. In this paper, we propose a technique to reduce a replay log while retaining its ability to reproduce a failure. While traditional logging records only system calls and signals, our technique leverages the compiler to selectively collect additional information on the fly. Upon a failure, the log can be reduced by analyzing itself. The collection is highly optimized. The additional runtime overhead of our technique, compared to a plain logging tool, is trivial (2.61% average) and the size of additional log is comparable to the original log. Substantial reduction can be cost-effectively achieved through a search based algorithm. The reduced log is guaranteed to reproduce the failure.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Kyu Hyung Lee", "author_profile_id": "81444605382", "affiliation": "Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA", "person_id": "P2690552", "email_address": "kyuhlee@cs.purdue.edu", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Yunhui Zheng", "author_profile_id": "81464648069", "affiliation": "Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA", "person_id": "P2690553", "email_address": "zheng16@cs.purdue.edu", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Nick Sumner", "author_profile_id": "81418595402", "affiliation": "Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA", "person_id": "P2690554", "email_address": "wnsumner@cs.purdue.edu", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Xiangyu Zhang", "author_profile_id": "81384614270", "affiliation": "Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA", "person_id": "P2690555", "email_address": "xyzhang@cs.purdue.edu", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1993498.1993528", "year": "2011", "article_id": "1993528", "conference": "PLDI", "title": "Toward generating reducible replay logs", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1993528"}
