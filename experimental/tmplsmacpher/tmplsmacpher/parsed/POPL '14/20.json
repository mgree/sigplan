It implements \na logical framework, called the Calculus of Induc\u00adtive Constructions, endowed with notational facilities \nand a mod\u00adular structure, allowing its use as a high-level language .t for the development of compositional \nmathematical components. Explicit potential proof structures are built by execution of ML tactics and \ntacticals, along a choice of proof schemes combinators. This al\u00adlows a wide spectrum of inference granularity, \nfrom step-by-step inference, to full decision procedures and re.ection principles. The validity of such \na potential proof is veri.ed by an independent core proof checker, whose meta-theory has been itself \nformally justi.ed. Coq proofs may be seen as programs in a high-level func\u00adtional notation, decorated \nby correctness assertions, and translators into existing programming languages such as OCaml and Haskell \nare available. Conversely, specialized subsystems allow the devel\u00adopment of algorithms with logical assertions, \nwhose validity is Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal \nor classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for pro.t or \ncommercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the .rst page.

The Coq Proof Assistant, an open-source soft\u00adware development, \nis in use by a large community of users. Some notable successes have been achieved, in formalized mathematics \n(the 4 color theorem, the odd order theorem in group theory), as well as in software certi.cation (a \nJava Card processing environ\u00adment, the CompCert certi.ed C compiling project). The talk will have two \nparts. First, G\u00e9rard Huet will evoke the genesis of Coq, its roots in early type theory, through the \nin.u\u00adence of Per Martin-L\u00f6f s dependent type theory, Jean-Yves Gi\u00adrard s polymorphic .-calculi F and \nF., Nicolaas de Bruijn s Au\u00adtomath languages and type-checkers, and the ML-LCF-Hope effort of Robin Milner \nand colleagues at the University of Edinburgh. He will discuss the rationale behind a few design decisions, \nand brie.y evoke the historical contributors in the 80s and 90 s. Hugo Herbe\u00adlin will then address a \ncouple of contemporary issues related to the logical status of equality, the proof methods, the high-level \nspeci.\u00adcation language, the user interfaces.  \n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "2535838", "abstract": "", "authors": [{"name": "G&#233;rard Huet", "author_profile_id": "81408602136", "affiliation": "INRIA Paris - Rocquencourt, Rocquencourt, France", "person_id": "P4383809", "email_address": "gerard.huet@inria.fr", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Hugo Herbelin", "author_profile_id": "81100052794", "affiliation": "INRIA Paris - Rocquencourt, Paris, France", "person_id": "P4383810", "email_address": "hugo.herbelin@inria.fr", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/2535838.2537848", "year": "2014", "article_id": "2537848", "conference": "POPL", "title": "30 years of research and development around Coq", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2537848"}
