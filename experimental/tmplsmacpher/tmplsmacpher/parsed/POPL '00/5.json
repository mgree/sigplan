We focus on flow-sensitive analyses, and give a simple and general result that shows that analyses that require the use of <italic>relational attributes</italic> for precision must be PSPACE-hard in general. We then show that if the language constructs are slightly strengthened to allow a computation to maintain a very limited summary of what happens along an execution path, inter-procedural analyses become EXPTIME-hard. We discuss applications of our results to a variety of analyses discussed in the literature. Our work elucidates the reasons behind the complexity results given by a number of authors, improves on a number of such complexity results, and exposes conceptual commonalities underlying such results that are not readily apparent otherwise.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Robert Muth", "author_profile_id": "81342505475", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ", "person_id": "PP39076436", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Saumya Debray", "author_profile_id": "81100148240", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ", "person_id": "P260626", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/325694.325704", "year": "2000", "article_id": "325704", "conference": "POPL", "title": "On the complexity of flow-sensitive dataflow analyses", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=325704"}
