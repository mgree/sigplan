This paper introduces a sweeping method which traverses only the live objects, so that sweeping can be done in time dependent only on the number of live objects in the heap.</p><p>This allows each collection to use time independent of the size of the heap, which can result in a large reduction of overall garbage collection time in empty heaps. Unfortunately, the algorithm used may slow down overall garbage collection if the heap is not so empty. So a way to select the sweeping algorithm depending on the heap occupancy is introduced, which can avoid any significant slowdown.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Yoo C.
