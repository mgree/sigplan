The key idea of this method is to upper approximate the least model of the program by a regular set of trees. In 1991, Fr&#252;hwirth, Shapiro, Vardi and Yardeni raised the question whether it can be more efficient to use the domain of sets of paths instead, <italic>i.e.</italic>, to approximate the least model by a regular set of words. We answer the question negatively by showing that type-checking for path-based analysis is as hard as the set-based one, that is DEXPTIME-complete. This result has consequences also in the areas of set constraints, automata theory and model checking.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Witold Charatonik", "author_profile_id": "81100210695", "affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institut f&#252;r Informatik, Im Stadtwald, D-66123 Saarbr&#252;cken, Germany and University of Wroclaw, Poland", "person_id": "P300621", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Andreas Podelski", "author_profile_id": "81100130920", "affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institut f&#252;r Informatik, Im Stadtwald, D-66123 Saarbr&#252;cken, Germany", "person_id": "PP14056587", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Jean-Marc Talbot", "author_profile_id": "81100516545", "affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institut f&#252;r Informatik, Im Stadtwald, D-66123 Saarbr&#252;cken, Germany", "person_id": "PP31045749", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/325694.325730", "year": "2000", "article_id": "325730", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Paths vs. trees in set-based program analysis", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=325730"}
