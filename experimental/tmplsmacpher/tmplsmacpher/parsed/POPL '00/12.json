Procedure extraction involves the following steps:<list><item><p>The statements to be extracted are identified (by the programmer or by a programming tool).</p></item><item><p>If the statements are not contiguous, they are moved together so that they form a sequence that can be extracted into a procedure, and so that the semantics of the original code is preserved.</p></item><item><p>The statements are extracted into a new procedure, and are replaced with an appropriate call.</p></item></list></p><p>This paper addresses step 2: in particular, the conditions under which it is possible to move a set of selected statements together so that they become &#8220;extractable&#8221;, while preserving semantics. Since semantic equivalence is, in general, undecidable, we identify sufficient conditions based on control and data dependences, and define an algorithm that moves the selected statements together when the conditions hold. We also include an outline of a proof that our algorithm is semantics-preserving.</p><p>While there has been considerable previous work on procedure extraction, we believe that this is the first paper to provide an algorithm for semantics-preserving procedures extraction given an arbitrary set of selected statements in an arbitrary control-flow graph.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Raghavan Komondoor", "author_profile_id": "81100544771", "affiliation": "Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1210 West Dayton Street, Madison, WI", "person_id": "PP14189333", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Susan Horwitz", "author_profile_id": "81100357689", "affiliation": "Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1210 West Dayton Street, Madison, WI", "person_id": "PP39039239", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/325694.325713", "year": "2000", "article_id": "325713", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Semantics-preserving procedure extraction", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=325713"}
