We present an analysis inspired by state-of-the-art pointer analyses that safety and accurately predicts which processes may turn up at what sites during the execution of a composite system. The analysis models sets of processes by sets of regular tree grammars enhanced with context-dependent counts, and it obtains its precision by combining a powerful redex materialisation with a strong redex reduction (in the manner of the strong updates performed in pointer analyses). The underlying ideas are flexible and scale up to general tree structures admitting powerful restructuring operations.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Hanne Riis Nielson", "author_profile_id": "81100316576", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University, Denmark", "person_id": "PP43118881", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Flemming Nielson", "author_profile_id": "81100316685", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P84491", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/325694.325711", "year": "2000", "article_id": "325711", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Shape analysis for mobile ambients", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=325711"}
