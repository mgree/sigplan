They have proved so useful, in fact, that some have called for their promotion to programming language features. In turn this has rekindled the age-old debate over the mechanism that belong in programming languages versus those that are better served by tools. The debate comes full circle when one contemplates code generation and methodological tool support for patterns. The authors compare and contrast programming languages, tools, and patterns to assess their relative merits and to clarify their roles in the development process.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Craig Chambers", "author_profile_id": "81100528252", "affiliation": "Dept. of Computer Science & Eng., University of Washington, Box 352350, Seattle, WA", "person_id": "PP39047060", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Bill Harrison", "author_profile_id": "81100010114", "affiliation": "IBM T.J.
