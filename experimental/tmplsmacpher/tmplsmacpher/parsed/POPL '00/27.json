To control interferences, the MA movement primitives are modified. On the new calculus, the <italic>Mobile Safe Ambients</italic> (SA), a type system is defined that: controls the mobility of ambients; removes all grave interferences. Other advantages of SA are: a useful algebraic theory; programs sometimes more robust (they require milder conditions for correctness) and/or simpler. These points are illustrated on several examples.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Francesca Levi", "author_profile_id": "81100296355", "affiliation": "University of Pisa, Italy", "person_id": "PP43118634", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Davide Sangiorgi", "author_profile_id": "81100628842", "affiliation": "INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, France", "person_id": "PP39051482", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/325694.325741", "year": "2000", "article_id": "325741", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Controlling interference in ambients", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=325741"}
