In order to describe properties of mobile computations we devise a modal logic that can talk about space as well as time, and that has the Ambient Calculus as a model.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Luca Cardelli", "author_profile_id": "81100123805", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "person_id": "PP39028545", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Andrew D.
