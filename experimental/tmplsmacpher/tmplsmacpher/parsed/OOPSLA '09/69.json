CA allows users to select \nrelevant components of industry-specific process hierarchies, reuse documents from past engagements, \ncollaboratively author requirements, and publish these requirements in a document based format. These \ndocuments can further be published to an asset repository for future reuse. Categories and Subject Descriptors \nD.2.1 [Software Engineering]: Requirement/Specifications.

Background Requirements-gathering in any medium-to-large sized business transformation \nproject is a complex activity that involves multiple participants from both the client and the consulting \ncompany. Typically, in such projects requirements are gathered adhering to methodologies built using \nstandardized process hierarchies (e.g. Oracle Unified Methodology [1]). The client s business processes \nand requirements are captured as gaps with respect to industry reference models and appropriate resolutions \n(new development, enhancements or reuse of existing implementations) are outlined. There are a plethora \nof general purpose requirements-gathering tools available but they do not support complex methodologies \nout of the box and require significant customization or configuration to be used in a specific client \nproject. Therefore, consultants prefer to gather and share requirements using general-purpose documentation \ntools, such as MS Word and Excel. However, as the project progresses, keeping track of information embedded \nin such documents becomes a cumbersome task. Some of the problems include: (1) maintaining traceability \nbetween various pieces of information embedded in these documents; (2) coordinating multiple copies of \nthe same information contained in multiple documents; (3) sharing and multi-user editing of documents; \nand (4) difficulty in reuse of such artifacts among members of the same project, and across projects. \nFor example, it is non-trivial to list all the requirements in a given project, as requirements are identified \nin the context of designing a process and each process is documented in a separate process description \ndocument (PDD). The common practice is to manually collect all the cross process information from the \nsource documents and then correlate the information between these documents. This may not be accurate \nor efficient and is clearly prone to human error. Also, consultants often refer to information gathered \nin previous projects to identify process customization and whether parts of the solution could be reused. \nHowever, a document-based approach does not support such reuse as information captured in a document \nloses the associated semantic meaning and the correlation between different information pieces. Additionally, \na document centric approach compromises project management as there is lack of project-wide visibility \non the progress or status of the requirements-gathering phase and lack of guarantee that all requirement \ndetails have been well captured. With Consultant Assistant (CA) we aim to solve some of these problems. \nCA helps practitioners in: (a) Visualizing existing reference process models and documenting the requirements \nin context of these reference process hierarchies. (b) Collaboratively editing information and finding \nrelevant information from current as well as past engagements. (c) Enabling reuse of information across \nprojects by maintaining traceability between different information pieces in a project (d) Enabling project \nmanagement by extracting the overall status of the requirement-gathering activities and generating early \nwarnings.  2. Approach CA follows a model-based approach to capture information instead of document-based \napproach. As opposed to creating free format or templatized documents, consultants use CA to capture \ninformation into a set of pre-defined model entities such as Business Process, Key Performance Indicator, \nGap, Variant etc. The model is semi-automatically built from business methodologies and can be customized \nfor each project level instantiation. The model also captures all allowable relationships between the \nmodel entities. Figure 1(a), shows a sample of the model instance. CA provides a well defined interface \nfor information entry for each model entity that allows consultants to add/delete/edit information and \nlinkages to other entities defined in the system. Figure 1(b), shows the information entry interface \nfor a Gap. Further, a set of deliverable templates can be defined as views over the information model. \nThese deliverables are auto\u00ad generated and mapped to the formal deliverables in the projects, Copyright \nis held by the author/owner(s). which corresponds to the documents consultants produce in non-OOPSLA \n2009, October 25-29, 2009, Orlando, FL, USA. CA approach. ACM 978-1-60558-768-4/09/10.  Fig 1: Consultant \nAssistant Tool Snapshot This saves time for the consultants and guarantees all project documents to be \nconsistent with the template. Figure 1(c) shows an instance of the Gap deliverable in html format. As \ninformation is now captured in a model format it becomes easy to collaboratively edit and consolidate \ninformation. Consultants can easily query for information of a particular type and create different views \nof the same data. Deliverables generated by CA are all consistent in style and reflect the specification \ndefined in the methodology (and refined by the project). Project management is simplified as the status \nof documents can be inferred from the information collected by the tool. For example, a PDD is supposed \nto list, among many others, the Variant s description, process flow and linked Requirements. Depending \non whether these attributes have been filled in the model, the status of completion of the PDD can be \neasily inferred. Further, once the project is complete, instead of harvesting the document for reusable \ninformation, in our approach, the model is cleansed (to remove any client specific information) and published \nto the asset repository for future reuse. This preserves the semantics of the content and relationships \nbetween them making future search easier.  3. Implementation CA is implemented over Rational Jazz platform \n[2], as a Web 2.0 [3] application and leverages Dojo [4] to provide a rich user interface. Since the \nmodel can be customized based on the project needs, all features of CA are either auto-generated from \nthe information model or query the model whenever required. The model is captured in ECORE [5] format \nand stored using an extended Jazz Repository. REST-based services are used to expose CRUD operations \non the information model. The Rational Asset Manager [6] is used as the storage and search repository. \nThe usage scenario of CA is as follows: (1) For a particular domain, the method team defines the information \nmodel for CA tooling (or refine the ones available for a given business methodology). (2) Components \nin CA are automatically generated using the above model as input. An instance of generated tool is deployed \nin the project environment. (3) In a project, the administrator can customize and configure a CA version \nbased on the project needs. These include: (a) making variations to the information model such as adding \nnew information entities, removing certain existing ones, (b) defining what are the deliverables needed. \n(4) Consultants use CA to author information. As this is a web based tool, multiple people can work on \nthe same instance. The authoring interface also provides collaboration, search and dash-boarding capabilities. \n(5) CA provides integration with an asset repository. Consultants can search for relevant types of data \nbased on certain pre-defined tags such as industry, deliverable type, etc. On finding relevant data, \nthey can automatically import the data to the project based instance of CA. (6) Once the project is over, \nan administrator can harvest content from this project to enrich the asset repository, for reuse of information \nacross projects. 4. Evaluation An initial version of CA was piloted in a large SAP project running with \nIBM. The tool was used to gather requirements for 20 processes and about 30 stakeholders were involved. \nIn the pilot, only the information entry and deliverable generation features were used. Even with the \nlimited features, users reported a significant value-add in terms of project wide visibility of data \nand quality of deliverables that were generated. The generated documents were found to contain fewer \nnumbers of incomplete sections, duplicate content and higher adherence to the templates. In future, we \nplan to deploy CA in multiple projects for both Oracle and SAP practice within our organization and collect \nuser experiences on the various features of the tool.  5.
