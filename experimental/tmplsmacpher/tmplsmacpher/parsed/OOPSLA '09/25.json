Onward! is the place for presenting original and radically \ndifferent ideas for program\u00ad ming languages, software engineering, and applications. Onward! takes a \nbroad and inclusive view of com\u00ad putation and in particular, has encouraged contributions in.uenced by \nother disciplines such as art, philosophy, psychology, sociology, anthropology, biology, economics, communities, \npolitics, and ethics. We consider Onward! the place for presentation of not so well proven but well argued \nideas including ground-break\u00ad ing ideas at an early stage, where empirical validation is not yet possible. \nThere is also an increasing need to describe systems and projects whose results are dif.cult to explain \nto non-experts, such as the behavior of long-running soft\u00ad ware systems for such a system, a .lm as opposed \nto a real-time demo might be the better medium. Early ideas and non-textual presentations of systems \nare usually rejected by program committees often properly because many of them lead indeed to vaporware. \nBut some of them have been the source for revolutions in hardware and software, in theory as well as \nin practice. Conferences where these types of ideas can be communicated, discussed, and scrutinized in \na thor\u00adough manner have become rare. Onward! is designed to be the forum where nascent ideas can be presented \nand discussed in a conference setting. There is still a long way to go to completely realize this concept, \nbut I think the .nal contributions selected for this year s conference are a very good step in this direction. \nThe Onward! keynote speaker is Thomas W. Malone, one of the thought leaders on how collective intelligence \nand information technology enable new types of project organization. Onward! also offers a wild mix of \nworkshop topics covering software development environments, fragile ideas, usability, the culture of \nprogramming languages, and green computing. Ground-breaking ideas are provided in the essay and research \npapers sessions. We have also established a session called Innovation in Progress, which focuses on emerging \nideas. A panel on green software will discuss the impact of hardware and software systems on earth s \ncarbon foot print. Feature and short .lms round out the conference with the presentation of software \nsystems and ideas from unusual perspectives. I am looking forward to a great conference.
