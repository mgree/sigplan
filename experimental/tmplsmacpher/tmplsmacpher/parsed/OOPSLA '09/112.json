Voice-over text In the winter term 2008, the DOLLI 2 project, a sequel to the highly successful \nDOLLI project, took place. And just like its predecessor, it differed substantially from other student \nprojects that are normally held at universities in the subject of computer science. The majority of the \nparticipants were students in their third semester. Although there were nearly thirty of them, they had \nto jointly work together to solve the problem they were posed. The teams that were formed were responsible \neach for one of the subsystems that were identified during the initial subsystem decomposition. Copyright \nis held by the autor/owner(s).

Representatives of the airport were involved during \nthe whole project duration, and their feedback was taken on multiple occasions to har\u00admonize the development \nand their expectations. To keep the administrative workload for the instructor as low as possible, the \nteams were taught to work in a self\u00adorganizing way. By employing Apple's Podcast Producer technology, \nthey could record their meetings for further reference. The videos were automatically captured, con\u00adverted \nand posted on the team's blog. One result of the preceding project was a three\u00addimensional representation \nof the airport that allows to navigate through the airport and watch trackable objects like cars and \nairplanes as they move around. The challenge of this year's project was to create an in\u00adtegration of \nthe facility management systems to enable em\u00adployees to view and change the status of devices like elevators, \nlights and ventilation from within the three\u00addimensional view. Additionally, an iPhone client had to \nbe developed to al\u00adlow the very same access from a mobile device while the user is on the road. The project \nnot only served as a teaching measure, but also to investigate topics in the field of software engineer\u00ading \nfrom a research perspective. One of the tools currently under development at the chair is called \"unicase\". \nIt aims at connecting all relevant artifacts that are important during software development. This total \nintegration allows to easily link related items like use cases and models of implementing classes as \nwell as project management artifacts like tasks and Sprint plan\u00adnings. This enables traceability not \nonly from requirements to code, but also takes the managerial aspects into account.  During the DOLLI \n2 project, it was investigated how changes on artifacts could be communicated best to af\u00adfected project \nmembers. We also investigated the use of video technology to im\u00adprove the requirements negotiation process. \nThe idea is to create visual representations of the scenarios to give the customer a good idea about \nhow the future system will work from the user's perspective. As the system does not exist at that point \nof time, we used GUI mock ups and green screen technology to make the video look as con\u00advincing as possible. \nIn the first project we already successfully combined both the Unified Process and Scrum, which is an \nagile process. To see if this switch is repeatable, we once again started with a more traditional process \nfor Requirements Engineering, System Design and Object Design. After the design was stable, most of the \nimplementation was done during a two week Scrum phase, which took place at the airport itself. Just like \nlast year, the switch worked without any major problems. At the end of the project the students presented \ntheir re\u00adsults in the target environment of terminal 1 at the Munich airport. More than 50 people attended \nthis event and were impressed by the actually working interaction between the DOLLI system and the existing \nfacility management sys\u00adtems. Although the required effort from the students was un\u00addoubtedly higher \nthan for typical student projects, the gain in real life project experience is a valuable preparation \nfor the time after graduation.   \n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "1639950", "abstract": "<p>The DOLLI 2 project was the successor to a large-scale educational student project course with a real customer, offered to students in their second year.
