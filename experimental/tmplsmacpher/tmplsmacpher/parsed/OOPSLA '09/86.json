The next generation of knowledge workers will be unlike any seen before. Millennials \nintroduce employees into the workforce whose use of technology is greater than any other previous generation. \nThis panel will explore what, if any impact the Millennial workforce will have upon the work environment. \nWhat will be the single most significant influence in the next 5 years that will affect knowledge workers \nand the organizations in which they work? In what way will traditional walls between work and private \nlife break down and is this a good thing? What types of devices will tomorrow s workers will use to get \ntheir job done? What impacts will consumer-facing applications have upon enterprise software and IT departments? \nHere is your op\u00adportunity to participate in the conversation with our panel of ex\u00adperts.
