While text may be expressiveenough to describe simple interactions \nbetween end-users and systems, it is severely limited when trying to unambi\u00adguously describe complex \ninteractions. Those potentiallyinvolve a plethora of stakeholders, mobile devices, and maybe even require \nrevolutionary interaction paradigms. For such innovative systems, we propose to employ \"video-based requirements \nengineering\". Our film submission shows how a filmic representation of a scenario increases its understandability. \nThe story is an example from the pervasive computing domain of home automation: The system protects the \nowner of an apartment from expensive water damage. After this exposition, the film shows how our tool \nmay front-load a video-based analysis into subsequent system development steps: The same scenario is \nused in a short overview of the currently available tool support.

Voice-over text The \nmovie you just saw was the filmic visualization of a scenario for a home automation system. We call this \nuse of Harald Stangl Asa MacWilliams Technische Universitaet Siemens AG Muenchen Corporate Technology \nChair for Applied Software asa.macwilliams@siemens.comEngineering stanglh@in.tum.de video technology \n\"video based requirements engineering\". It helps a diverse set of stakeholders get a better picture and \ncommon understanding of how a future system might work in real life, especially when the types of interaction \ngo be\u00adyond standard mouse and keyboard. To support the creation and further use of these videos, we developed \na tool called XRave, the requirements analy\u00adsis video editor. XRave has two main functionalities: First, \nit allows the creation of multi path videos, so that alternative flows of events can be reviewed and \nthe design space can be evaluated visually. You can also use stubs for alternative paths that you want \nto model, but where no video material exists yet. Second, you can annotate relevant people and objects \ninthe video, as well as their constellations and interactions that lead to certain system behavior. This \nensures agree\u00adment between stakeholders on focus and system scope. The structuring and annotation of \nvideo material enables users to search and reuse clips in subsequent iterations or projects. XRave can \nalso generate a UML-like sequence diagramentirely based on the annotations. This provides a more formalized \nrepresentation of the ongoing action and can serve as a starting point for functional or structural systemdecomposition. \nIn the future, we want to integrate automatic object de\u00adtection algorithms, as well as a mechanism to \nembed user interface prototypes from early phases of the requirements engineering process.
