Introduction This workshop will explore the contributions \nthat software research can make to the challenge of climate change. Cli\u00admate change is likely to be the \nde.ning issue of the 21st Century [1]. Recent studies indicate that climate change is accelerating, con.rming \nthe most pessimistic of scenarios identi.ed by climate scientists [2]. Our past use of fossil fuels commit \nthe world to around 2C average temperature rise since the pre-industrial era [3], and, unless urgent \nand drastic cuts are made, further heating is likely to trigger any of a number of climate change tipping \npoints [4]. The re\u00adsults will be a dramatic reduction of food production and water supplies, more extreme \nweather events, the spread of disease, sea level rise, ocean acidi.cation, and mass extinc\u00adtions [1]. \nWe are faced with the twin challenges of mitigation (avoiding the worst climate change effects by rapidly \ntransi- Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).

These challenges \nare global in nature, and pervade all as\u00adpects of society. To address them, we will need researchers, \nengineers, policymakers, and educators from many different disciplines to come the the table and ask \nwhat they can con\u00adtribute. There are both short term challenges (such as how to deploy, as rapidly as \npossible, existing technology to pro\u00adduce renewable energy; how to design government policies and international \ntreaties to bring greenhouse gas emissions under control) and long term challenges (such as how to complete \nthe transition to a global carbon-neutral society by the latter half of this century). In nearly all \nthese challenges, software has a major role to play as a critical enabling tech\u00adnology. 2. The Challenge \nSo, for the software research community, we can frame the challenge as follows: How can we, as experts \nin software technology, and as the creators of future software tools and techniques, apply our particular \nknowledge and experience to the challenge of climate change? How can we understand and exploit the particular \nintellectual assets of our commu\u00adnity our ability to: think computationally;  understand and model \ncomplex inter-related systems;  build useful abstractions and problem decompositions;  manage and evolve \nlarge-scale socio-technical design ef\u00adforts;  build the information systems and knowledge manage\u00adment \ntools that empower effective decision-making;  develop and verify complex control systems on which we \nnow depend;  create user-friendly and task-appropriate interfaces to complex information and communication \ninfrastructures.   In short, how can we apply our research strengths to make signi.cant contributions \nto the problems of mitigation and adaptation of climate change? This workshop will be the .rst in a series, \nintended to de\u00advelop a community of researchers actively engaged in this challenge, and to .esh out a \ndetailed research agenda that leverages existing research ideas and capabilities. Therefore we welcome \nany kind of response to this challenge state\u00adment. 3. Topics We welcome the active participation of software \nresearchers and practitioners interested in any aspect of this challenge. The participants will themselves \ndetermine the scope and thrusts of this workshop, so this list of suggested topics is intended to act \nonly as a starting point: requirements analysis for complex global change prob\u00adlems;  integrating sustainability \ninto software system design;  green IT, including power-aware computing and auto\u00admated energy management; \n developing control systems to create smart energy grids and improve energy conservation;  developing \ninformation systems to support urban plan\u00adning, transport policies, green buildings, etc.;  software \ntools for open collaborative science, especially across scienti.c disciplines;  design patterns for \nsuccessful emissions reduction strate\u00adgies;  social networking tools to support rapid action and knowledge \nsharing among communities;  educational software for hands-on computational sci\u00adence;  knowledge management \nand decision support tools for designing and implementing climate change policies;  tools and techniques \nto accelerate the development and validation of earth system models by climate scientists;  data sharing \nand data management of large scienti.c datasets;  tools for creating and sharing visualizations of climate \nchange data;  4. Structure Our intent is to create a lively, interactive discussion, to fos\u00adter brainstorming \nand community building. Registration will be open to all. However, we strongly encourage participants \nto submit (one or more) brief (1-page) responses to the chal\u00adlenge statement, either as: Descriptions \nof existing research projects relevant to the challenge statement (preferably with pointers to pub\u00adlished \npapers and/or online resources);  Position papers outlining potential research projects.  We encourage \nparticipants to be creative and forward\u00adthinking: think of the future, and think big! There will be no \nformal publication of proceedings. In\u00adstead we will circulate all submitted papers to participants in \nadvance of the workshop, via the workshop website, and invite participants to revise/update/embellish \ntheir contribu\u00adtions in response to everyone elses contributions. Our plan is to write a post-workshop \nreport, which will draw on both the submitted papers and the discussions during the work\u00adshop. This report \nwill lay out a suggested agenda for both short-term and long-term research in response to the chal\u00adlenge, \nand act as a roadmap for subsequent workshops and funding proposals. 5.
