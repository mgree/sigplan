Introduction In this workshop we focus on the notions of reflection and retros\u00adpective: \nreflection usually refers to the individual's thinking about what he or she has accomplished; retrospective \nis usually con\u00adducted in teams, and is partially based on the individuals' reflec\u00adtions performed during \nthe retrospective sessions. The reflective practice perspective, first introduced by Donald Sch\u00f6n [2, \n3] guides professional practitioners (such as architects, managers, musicians and others) towards the \nexamination and rethinking of their professional creations during and after the ac\u00adcomplishment of the \ncreation process. The working assumption is that such a reflection process improves both proficiency \nand per\u00adformance within such professions. Analysis of the field of soft\u00adware engineering and the kind \nof work that software engineers usually accomplish supports the adoption of the reflective practice perspective \nto software engineering. The two main books which present the reflective practice perspective are The \nReflective Practitioner [2] and Educating the Reflective Practitioner [3]. While the first book presents \nprofes\u00adsions for which reflective thinking is (or should be) inherent in, the second book focuses on \nhow to educate students of such pro\u00adfessions to become reflective practitioners. In these two books Sch\u00f6n \nanalyses the added advantages one may obtain from conti\u00adnuously examining one s practice and one s thinking \nabout one's Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).

Interestingly, Sch\u00f6n did not discuss in his two original books the application of the \nreflective practice perspective with respect to software engineering. He did address this issue in a \nlater interview [4]. In this workshop we examine the application of the reflective practitioner perspective \nin software engineering settings, different models of reflections and retrospectives in software development \nteams, outcomes of such processes, and relationships among the team and the individuals in such processes. \n 2. Workshop Goals . Participants share their research work on reflections and retro\u00ad spectives in software \ndevelopment teams and processes . Participants build a community that explores the potential contribution \nand implementation of reflections and retrospec\u00ad tives to software development projects . Participants \ninvestigate cognitive, social and organizational aspects of reflections and retrospectives in software \ndevelop\u00ad ment environments . Participants deepen their understanding of how to facilitate reflections \nand retrospectives in software teams 3. Activities and Format The workshop consists of theory-and practice-based \npresenta\u00adtions, group work and discussions. Workshop activities include: experience sharing with respect \nto case studies in which reflective processes took place, and exploration of how the awareness to reflective \nprocesses in software engineering may foster cognitive, social and organizational processes.  4. Workshop \nOrganizers DR. ORIT HAZZAN is an associate professor at the Department of Education in Technology and \nScience of the Technion Israel Institute of Technology. In May 2004 she published her book Human Aspects \nof Software Engineering, co-authored with the late Jim Tomayko [5]. Her second book Agile Software Engi\u00adneering \n co-authored with Yael Dubinsky, was published by Springer in 2008 [1]. In parallel to her research work, \nshe is a consultant for several software projects in the Israeli software industry. She is the program \nco-chair of the 2007 and 2010 IEEE SwSTE (Software -Science, Technology and Engineering) confe\u00adrences. \nShe presents her research work at computer science and software engineering education conferences (e.g., \nSIGCSE), as well as at conferences on software engineering in general (such as, ICSE, OOPSLA) and agile \nsoftware development in particular (e.g., the Agile Conferences). ACM 978-1-60558-768-4/09/10.  DR. \nYAEL DUBINSKY is affiliated with the Software and Services group in IBM Haifa Research Lab (HRL). She \nis also a visiting member of the human-computer interaction research group at the Department of Computer \nand Systems Science at La Sapienza, Rome, and for more than ten years she is the instructor of project\u00adbased \ncourses in the Department of Computer Science at the Technion Israel Institute of Technology. Her research \ninterests involve aspects in software engineering and information systems. Yael has a significant experience \nwith guiding agile implementa\u00adtion processes in the industry and academia. She has presented her work \n(since 2002) and co-facilitated tutorials (since 2005) in Agile and XP conferences. In the last two years \nshe co-chaired the ICSE Workshop on Software Development Governance and the research stage in the Agile \nconferences. Her book on Agile Soft\u00adware Engineering [1], co-authored with Orit Hazzan, was pub\u00adlished \nby Springer in 2008. References [1] Hazzan, O. and Dubinsky, Y. (2008).
