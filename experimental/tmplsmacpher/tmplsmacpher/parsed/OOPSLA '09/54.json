Introduction In the field of Web Services interest has now turned towards \nCloud computing and delivering Software As A Service. In con\u00adtrast to SOA, we are already starting to \nsee widespread and suc\u00adcessful use of cloud and software as a service. Thus, the concept of SOA while \nnot delivering on its promises, resulted in an evolu\u00adtion towards Cloud Computing and SAAS. We are starting \nto see reasons why the focus on services is important. This poster will outline the results of the related \nworkshop. Due to the interactive nature of the workshop a number of ques\u00adtions will be explored such \nas: Can Cloud Computing be used without the traditional clus\u00adtered, high\u00adavailability and highly complicated \nsoftware stacks from big vendors or high profile open source initiatives?  Is Cloud Computing a viable \noption for legacy mission critical backend system typically supported by mainframes?  Is Cloud Computing \na suitable platform for government self services?  What impact will Cloud Computing have on other industries? \n Will the move to Cloud based technologies strengthen the arguments put forward by Nicholas G. Carr \nthat IT doesn t matter ?  Can Cloud Computing change the way we organize IT?  The workshop will focus \non the design issues surrounding the cloud and will provide summary of the comments and conclusions reached \nduring the workshop. The balance of industrial to educa\u00adtional input in each issue will provide a more \nbalanced view and should result in interesting new topics for further discussion:  2. Organizers There \nare multiple organizers of the workshop from industry and academia. Organizers include:. Ruth Lennon, \nResearcher &#38; Lecturer in Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Ireland.  Lars Arne Skar, CTO of \nMiles Consulting based in Norway.  Morten Udnaes, Systems Architect, Miles Consulting, Norway.  Arne \nBerre, Chief Scientist in SINTEF ICT Research Unit.  Dr. Amir Zeid, is the program lead of Computer \nScience and Information Systems at the American University of Kuwait.  Dumitru Roman, Senior Researcher \nin Semantic Technology Institute, Innsbruck, Austria.  Einar Landre, is a practicing software professional \nwith 25 years experience.  Prof. Dr. Willem\u00adJan van den Heuvel is the managing director of the European \nResearch Institute of Services Science.  The organizers of the related workshop have produced this poster \nso as to provide a moderated and insightful summary of the views of the workshop participants.  3. Poster \nFormat The poster will contain a number of sections which will outline what the participants expected \nfrom the workshop; the topics identified for discussion; survey results; participant comments; workshop \nconclusions and finally problems that were identified. Each section of the poster will include short \nterms or com\u00adments as made by the participants. These comments will be gath\u00adered by the organisers and \norganised in a coherent format for presentation. As with last years workshop we would expect some of \nthe comments to be controversial. Often it is in the need to convert a utopian albeit intangible solution \nto something more concrete for the commercial world that provides the most interest\u00ading steps towards \nnew thinking. 4. Questions: Designing for the Cloud Some of the more concrete questions that it is envisaged \nwill be discussed in this poster include.: What patterns are appropriate for the modeling, design and \nanalysis of Cloud Computing?  What are the important semantic aspects and ontologies for services in \nthe Cloud.  Can we design the Cloud to avoid vendor lock\u00adin?  How can we design to alleviate security \nfears in the Cloud?  How can SoaML be applied to reduce the risk of failure of rapid development of \nCloud applications.  5. Comments The use of adaptable resources on a plug-n-play, or plug-n-pay, basis \npromotes scalability if and when needed. The reduction in the requirement to purchase hardware in this \ntime of recession has not gone unnoticed by many large companies. The ability to scale up and down as \nnecessary with reduced overhead is advantageous to even the smallest of enterprises. Thus the design \nof the system must enable flexible and efficient delivery of services on dynamic and often ad-hoc basis. \nWork on evaluating the need for and abil\u00adity of cloud computing has been discussed in [2]. Further work \non the appropriate design of cloud systems will alleviate many of the problems they have discussed. It \nis anticipated that the poster will contain many comments by experienced cloud developers outlin\u00ading \nthe most significant issues that they have had to deal with. 6. Summary A workshop on the design of \ncloud using established and indeed innovative best practice techniques will explore the practical is\u00adsues \ninvolved in the design of enterprise scale systems. The issues identified by the workshop will be presented \nin a poster which will be available online as well as being displayed at OOPSLA 2009. The results of \nthe workshop will be published on https://wiki.miles.no/display/EXT/oopsla09_cloud_computing.
