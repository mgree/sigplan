Introduction Cloud computing is shown \nitself as the next evolution of web services married with Grid computing. Moving from Grid to In\u00adfrastructure \nAs A Services (IAAS) does not take much of a leap of imagination. Software As A Service (SAAS) is one \nof the more notable commercial successes of web services and also leads di\u00adrectly to the development \nof cloud computing as a technique to Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).

Without getting bogged down in acronyms \nit is clear to see where Cloud computing will most benefit enterprise. Due to the relatively recent development \nof cloud and it s speed of adoption by the commercial market it is clear at this stage that many issues \nhave arisen that could have been avoided. Further it can be seen that some more serious issues need to \nbe addressed very quickly if cloud computing is to continue to play a part in modern enterprise application \ndevelopment: This poster will outline the results of the related workshop. Due to the interactive nature \nof the workshop a number of ques\u00adtions will be explored such as: will the move to Cloud based tech\u00adnologies \nstrengthen the arguments put forward by Nicholas G. Carr that IT doesn t matter ? The workshop will focus \non the implementation and opera\u00adtional issues surrounding the cloud and will provide summary of the comments \nand conclusions reached during the workshop. The balance of industrial to educational input in each issue \nwill pro\u00advide a more balanced view and should result in interesting new topics for further discussion: \n 2. Organizers There are multiple organizers of the workshop from industry and academia. Organizers include:. \n Ruth Lennon, Researcher &#38; Lecturer in Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Ireland.  Lars Arne \nSkar, CTO of Miles Consulting based in Norway.  Morten Udnaes, Systems Architect, Miles Consulting, \nNorway.  Arne Berre, Chief Scientist in SINTEF ICT Research Unit.  Dr. Amir Zeid, is the program lead \nof Computer Science and Information Systems at the American University of Kuwait.  Dumitru Roman, Senior \nResearcher in Semantic Technology Institute, Innsbruck, Austria.   Einar Landre, is a practicing software \nprofessional with 25 years experience.  Prof. Dr. Willem\u00adJan van den Heuvel is the managing director \nof the European Research Institute of Services Science.  The organizers of the related workshop have \nproduced this poster so as to provide a moderated and insightful summary of the views of the workshop \nparticipants. The poster may provide con\u00adtroversial opinions along with insightful comments on best prac\u00adtice! \n3. Poster Format The poster will contain a number of sections which will outline what the participants \nexpected from the workshop; the topics identified for discussion; survey results; participant comments; \nworkshop conclusions and finally problems that were identified. The poster will include short terms or \ncomments as made by the participants, gathered and organised by organisers into a co\u00adherent format for \npresentation. As with last years workshop we would expect some of the comments to be controversial. Often \nit is in the need to convert a utopian albeit intangible solution to something more concrete for the \ncommercial world that provides the most interesting steps towards new thinking. 4. Questions: Implications \nfor the Cloud Some of the more concrete questions that it is envisaged will be discussed in this poster \ninclude: Is Cloud Computing a viable option for legacy mission critical backend systems typically supported \nby mainframes?  To save money and increase services levels, more and more communication between people \nand government services are carried out through the internet. Is Cloud Computing a suit\u00adable platform \nfor government self\u00adservices..  Will the move to Cloud based technologies strengthen the arguments put \nforward by Nicholas G. Carr that IT doesn t matter ?  Can Cloud Computing change the way we organize \nIT? Is there a need for an IT\u00addepartment when all physical concepts like servers and networks are gone? \n Has SOA been replaced by Cloud [1]?  Will SaaS be overshadowed by Cloud?  The final list of topics \nwill be decided upon by the workshop members.  5. Comments Pay as you go has worked in the telephony \nmarket for many years and is now being adapted for software services on the internet. The releasing of \nhardware processing resources in such a manner has become a topic of much discussion. In fact NASA and \na num\u00adber of research organizations have been utilizing home users un\u00adused processing power for quite \nsome time. The definition of what constitutes cloud computing is in itself somewhat vague [2] as the \nterm Web 2.0 progresses to Web 3.0 without any significant change in technologies. Work on evaluating \nthe need for and abil\u00adity of cloud computing has been discussed in [3] and defines some of the difficulties \ninvolved. Commercial applications such as Amazon s Elastic Compute Cloud (aws.amazon.com/ec2/), Sky-Tap, \nGridLayer and CohesiveFT stem from large organisations to smaller enterprises seizing a niche in the \nmarket. It is interesting to see that the commercial applications of Cloud runs from SAAS, IAAS, Platforms \nas a Service (PAAS), Storage services, monitor\u00ading services, modelling services and security services \nto name but a few. The issue of security services to run over the cloud is perhaps on of the most interesting. \nWith the processing of data farmed out to unknown service providers the increasing need for tightened \nsecurity is a must. Indeed it may be seen that the lack of trust and fear of security issues may provide \nthe largest stumbling block to the acceptance of cloud based services. The poster provides a summary \nof the thoughts of both industry and academic represen\u00adtatives on this and many other issues. 6. Summary \nA workshop on the implementation and operational implications of cloud using established and indeed innovative \nbest practice techniques will explore the practical issues involved in the release of cloud systems to \nthe market. The issues identified by the work\u00adshop will be presented in a poster which will be available \nonline as well as being displayed at OOPSLA 2009. The results of the workshop will be published on: https://wiki.miles.no/display/EXT/oopsla09_cloud_computing. \n References [1] unknown author, SOA is dead; long live Services, aps\u00adblog.burtongroup.com/2009/01/soa-is-dead-long-live-services.html \n[2] Vaquero, Luis M., Rodera-Merino, Luis, Caceres, Juan and Lindner Maik, A Break in the Clouds: Towards \na Cloud Definition, SIG-COMM Computer Communication Review, ACM, Vol. 39, Issue 1, December 2008.
