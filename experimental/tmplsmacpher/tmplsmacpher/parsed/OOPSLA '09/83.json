The panel will address questions of interest that include: How are architecture practices applied in a world where 'agile' must co-exist with more traditional sequential processes and the scale and scope of legacy systems? and - What are the organization structures, tools, methods, and education/training strategies that can be used to maximize the delivered value and reduce the cost of system owner-ship? This panel is intended to build on the outcomes of OOPSLA 2009 workshop with the same title.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Steven Fraser", "author_profile_id": "81339499863", "affiliation": "Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA, USA", "person_id": "P1728683", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Ethan Hadar", "author_profile_id": "81319493006", "affiliation": "CA Inc, Haifa, Israel", "person_id": "P1728684", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Irit Hadar", "author_profile_id": "81319493041", "affiliation": "University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel", "person_id": "P1728685", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Dennis Mancl", "author_profile_id": "81100418080", "affiliation": "Alcatel-Lucent, New Jersey, USA", "person_id": "P1728686", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Grenville (Randy) Miller", "author_profile_id": "81100160769", "affiliation": "Microsoft, RTP, NC, USA", "person_id": "P1728687", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Bill Opdyke", "author_profile_id": "81100640873", "affiliation": "Motorola Inc, Chicago, IL, USA", "person_id": "P1728688", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1639950.1640041", "year": "2009", "article_id": "1640041", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Architecture in an agile world", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1640041"}
