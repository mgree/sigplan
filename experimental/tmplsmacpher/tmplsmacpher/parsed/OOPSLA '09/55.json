The goals of the workshop are to bring together \neducators and developers to share their object\u00adoriented expertise, and to provide a forum for discussion \nof teaching techniques and pedagogical goals. The theme of last year s workshop was pedagogically sound \nexamples for object orientation; this year s workshop continues that theme, but rather than focusing \non examples that demon\u00adstrate sound object-oriented design, it will focus on exam\u00adples that expose bad \npractice and so lead to better apprecia\u00adtion of good practice, as obtained by following sound object\u00adoriented \nprinciples. In this year s workshop we focus on the use of exam\u00adples that expose bad practice. Students, \nwhen presented with good (killer) solutions to problems, can appreciate how the solutions incorporate \nsound OO principles, but they may not understand what is wrong with alternative solutions that also appear \ngood to them. It is important that students learn how to look at a bad solution to a problem and critique \nit with regard to standard OO principles, such as Law of Demeter or the Liskov Substitution Principle. \nSkill at critiquing bad code is valuable in code reviews and in other situations in\u00advolving reviews of \nexisting or proposed solutions to prob\u00adlems. Michael E. Caspersen University of Aarhus mec@daimi.au.dk \n Good examples that demonstrate bad practice can be as simple as a section of code with a poorly named \nvariable that misleads the reader regarding the behavior of the code. Alternatively, a good example might \nbe one that looks to be well-designed at good at .rst glance, but demonstrates fragility when changes \nare attempted. Another example might consist of an inappropriate application of a design pattern. Also, \na large method that can easily be refactored using the Extract Method refactoring could be another ex\u00adample. \nSome examples could demonstrate several bad practices, and so require a series of design changes or transformations \nin order to be converted into a good solution. In our workshop, participants discussed examples expos\u00ading \nbad practice that they have seen or used in their teach\u00ading, whether it be in a traditional classroom \nor in an industry training setting. Such examples are often found in students solutions to problems or \nin existing code bases in industrial applications. This poster reports on the outcome of this year s \nfull-day workshop, held at OOPSLA on Sunday,October 25.
