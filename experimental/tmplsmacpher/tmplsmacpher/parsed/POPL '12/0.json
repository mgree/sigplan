Two contributions stand out as fundamental: the development of what is now known \nas Hoare logic, and Communicating Sequen\u00adtial Processes. Hoare logic is a system for reasoning about \nimpera\u00adtive programs. It was introduced in the 1969 article An Axiomatic Basic for Computer Programming \n, which is perhaps the most in\u00ad.uential 6-page paper ever published in CACM. Drawing on ear\u00adlier work \nof Robert Floyd, an entire sub-area of computer science has developed from Hoare s initial ideas; many \nmodern veri.cation systems build on Hoare logic. Only 9 years later, CACM published Hoare s paper on \nCom\u00admunicating Sequential Processes (CSP). Contemporary with Mil\u00adner s CCS, but pursuing complementary \ngoals, CSP has been enor\u00admously in.uential. It provided the basis for the occam program\u00adming language \nand its realization in the Transputer; it has been used for modeling and verifying the concurrency properties \nof critical software systems; and it inspired a .owering of subsequent concur\u00adrency research. Although \neither of these contributions would alone justify the achievement award, Hoare is doing more with his \nUnifying Theo\u00adries research, which aims to unify theories of programming across paradigm, abstraction \nlevel and semantic style. Beyond all of this, Tony is renowned for his unfailing courtesy, his inspiration, \nand his dedication to his chosen calling. He is the epitome of a scholar and a gentleman. A Note from \nPeter O Hearn As the POPL program was being planned, following a suggestion from Andy Gordon, the POPL \nPC, ERC, and organizing commit\u00adtees came up with the novel idea of accompanying the presentation of the \nSIGPLAN award with an interview of Tony. When the POPL chairs, John Field and Michael Hicks, approached \nme with this idea and asked if I would consider conducting the interview, I was .lled with delight. Obviously, \nTony s ideas have in.uenced me enormously. At the beginning of my career I read essentially all of his \npapers cover\u00ading a wide range of topics including language design, program\u00adming methodology, and theory. \nThe signi.cance and depth of his contributions is plain to see, but in reading his papers something else \ngrabbed ahold of me time and again: their marvellous simplic\u00adity. Many of Hoare s contributions including \nhis work on Hoare logic, data types, data abstraction, structured programming, re.ne\u00adment, monitors, \nCSP and unifying theories seem so natural as to be inevitable, almost obvious ... in retrospect. How \ndid he do it? How did he produce so many beautiful, sim\u00adple ideas? Even though in recent years I have \ngotten to know Tony as a colleague and friend, and learnt a tremendous amount from him, I confess that \nI still don t know. During the interview we will go into Tony s relentless drive towards simplicity, \nhis recollections and his hopes, and perhaps a few questions that I don t want him or you to know about \njust yet!
