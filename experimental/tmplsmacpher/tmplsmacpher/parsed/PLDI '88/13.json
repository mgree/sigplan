We describe the use of <italic>flowback analysis</italic> to provide information on causal relationships between events in a program's execution without re-executing the program for debugging. We introduce a mechanism called <italic>incremental tracing</italic> that, by using semantic analyses of the debugged program, makes the flowback analysis practical with only a small amount of trace generated during execution. We extend flowback analysis to apply to parallel programs and describe a method to detect race conditions in the interactions of the co-operating processes.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "B. P.
