It describes a new data type called a <italic>promise</italic> that was designed to support asynchronous calls. Promises allow a caller to run in parallel with a call and to pick up the results of the call, including any exceptions it raises, in a convenient and type-safe manner. The paper also discusses efficient composition of sequences of asynchronous calls to different locations in a network.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "B.
