Because structures can be connected by pointers, deciding if two statements conflict requires knowledge of the possible aliases for the locations that they access.</p><p>This paper describes a dataflow computation that produces a conservative description of the aliases visible at any point in a program. The data structure that records aliases is an alias graph. It also labels instances of structures so that the objects referenced at different points in a program can be compared. This paper shows how alias graphs can be used to detect potential conflicts.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "J. R.
