We use sequential character strings to write sequential \nprograms to control sequential computers. No wonder concurrency remains elusive. How did we come to be \nhere? The high cost of vacuum tube logic forced sequence upon early computer builders. Sequential character \nstrings were the economic way to describe what sequential computers should do. Sequential programs controlled \nthe expensive part of the machine, namely logic. The lethargic pace of logic circuits masked the cost \nof moving data over distance, allowing program\u00adming languages to ignore the cost of communication. Today, \nthe time delay and energy cost of communicating over distance dominate modern computers; logic is essen\u00adtially \nfree. Why then, do programming languages continue to control logic and largely ignore communication? \nIt will take a broad effort to escape our sequential prison, requiring changes in hardware, programming \nnota\u00adtions and the ways in which they are expressed. Most im\u00adportantly, it will require recognizing that \nwe are in sequen\u00adtial prison, and planning for an escape.

Biography Ivan Sutherland was a Vice President and Fellow \nat Sun Microsystems where he helped Sun to develop new tech\u00adnologies. After retiring from Sun in 2009, \nIvan and Marly Roncken established the Asynchronous Research Center (ARC) at Portland State University. \nIvan is now a full-time volunteer at PSU with the title Visiting Scientist. He offers courses related \nto his research interests in self-timed and concurrent systems. Ivan has enjoyed a broad variety of work \nexperiences. He was the second director of DARPA s computer office. He and Carver Mead founded Caltech \ns Computer Science effort. Prior to that he taught at Harvard and the University of Utah. In 1968 he \nand Dave Evans started the computer graphics company that bears their names. He and two other partners \nstarted Advanced Technology Ventures in 1980. He has served on many corporate boards. Ivan s main interests \nare family and research. At the ARC he combines both; Marly and Ivan married in 2006. Together they explore \nalternatives to conventional com\u00adputer design. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). SPLASH 11 Companion, \nOctober 22 27, 2011, Portland, Oregon, USA.
