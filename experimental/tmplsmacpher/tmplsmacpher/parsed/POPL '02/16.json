Iterative source-to-source program transformations are designed constructively by composition of source-to-semantics, semantics-to-transformed semantics and semantics-to-source abstractions applied to fixpoint trace semantics. The correctness of the transformations is expressed through observational and performance abstractions. The framework is illustrated on three examples: constant propagation, program specialization by online and offline partial evaluation and static program monitoring.", "authors": [{"name": "Patrick Cousot", "author_profile_id": "81100592699", "affiliation": "&#201;cole normale sup&#233;rieure, 75230 Paris cedex 05, France", "person_id": "PP39049972", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Radhia Cousot", "author_profile_id": "81100592574", "affiliation": "&#201;cole polytechnique, 91128 Palaiseau cedex, France", "person_id": "PP14204543", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/503272.503290", "year": "2002", "article_id": "503290", "conference": "POPL", "title": "Systematic design of program transformation frameworks by abstract interpretation", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=503290"}
