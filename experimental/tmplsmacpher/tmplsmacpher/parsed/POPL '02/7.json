This work reports our experience in using a linear/affine typed &pi;-calculus for the analysis and development of type systems of programming languages, focussing on secure information flow analysis. After presenting a basic typed calculus for secrecy, we demonstrate its usage by a sound embedding of the dependency core calculus (DCC) and by the development of a novel type discipline for imperative programs which extends both a secure multi-threaded imperative language by Smith and Volpano and (a call-by-value version of) DCC. In each case, the embedding gives a simple proof of noninterference.", "authors": [{"name": "Kohei Honda", "author_profile_id": "81100624236", "affiliation": "University of London, UK", "person_id": "PP31050384", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Nobuko Yoshida", "author_profile_id": "81100632656", "affiliation": "University of Leicester, UK", "person_id": "PP39051644", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/503272.503281", "year": "2002", "article_id": "503281", "conference": "POPL", "title": "A uniform type structure for secure information flow", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=503281"}
