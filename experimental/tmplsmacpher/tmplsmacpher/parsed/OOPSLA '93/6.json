Introduction The Travelers has been applying object technology (both Smalltalk and C++) to \nproduction systems development efforts since early 1992. Prior to that time, there had been some internal \nresearch into the viability and maturity of object technology, tools, and techniques. As the result of \na business process reengineering study, one business area determined that the fundamental restructuring \nof its business required new systems that could best be constructed using object techniques and the C++ \nlanguage. It was shortly after the C++ project was begun that the Travelers decided to attempt a Smalltalk \nproject. The reasons were quite straight forward. We hoped to gain a better understanding of the existing \nreligious wars raging between the Smalltalk and C++ development communities. It was also assumed that \nfostering some degree of competition between these groups would help identify any implementation risks \nand benefits both common and different between them. Perhaps most important was the need to understand \njust what learning activities were required for staff with various backgrounds and experience levels. \n 2. Jump Starting an Organization Introducing object technology in a new organization is a complex and \ndemanding task. The limiting factors are the human resource and the opportunities (i.e., projects) that \nmay be undertaken. We needed to adopt an approach that would maximally leverage our small number of experienced \nOT staff. We also decided to select a project that would provide low risk and moderate return so that \nwe would have leeway in confronting any unexpected situations. Selecting a lower risk project also enabled \nus to spend a good deal of effort on the learning curve. With regard to the human resource, what we did \nwas hire an experienced outside resource to play the role of mentor to the rest of the team. This team \nincluded a range of experience levels: an internal management development program graduate, a veteran \nhost application developer, a college graduate new hire, a college co-op student, and a junior software \nengineer. This was a group of high-energy individuals with the capability to learn quickly. As for the \nproject, we searched for a solid opportunity that did not lie on the business critical list. The project \nthat lit this profile was the Premium Audit System. Approximately six months after beginning that project, \nour group was approached to assist in the development of another Smalltalk project that was in fact business \ncritical. That second project was the Litigation Management System. The discussion that follows focuses \nmainly on these two projects, although we have since begun three additional projects that are in various \ndegrees of completion at this time. It is our expectation that each project will produce a core team \nof experienced Smalltalkers over the next several years. By seeding subsequent projects with the veterans \nof the current projects, the number of projects should grow geometrically, as demand permits.  3. Our \nTwo First Smalltalk Projects Our first two Smalltalk development efforts were very different in terms \nof context and overall characteristics. The Premium Audit System could best be described as an exploratory \ndevelopment effort with many objectives complementing the actual system delivery to the business. These \nincluded exploring training, development cycle, programming environment, and politico-cultural investigations. \nOn the other hand, the Litigation Management System was more business critical and less interested in \nthese other issues than in delivering a working system on the date specified.  Premium Audit System \nThe Premium Audit System is designed to support the auditing of our commercial customers general liability, \nautomobile, and garage premium charges. Essentially, the objective is to match the planned usage of insurance \nagainst the actual usage of insurance, as driven by such factors as payroll, number and type of vehicles, \nbuildings, and other insurable items. At the close of each term, Travelers inspects the customers actual \nbasis for each coverage to determine whether Travelers owes the customer a reimbursement or whether the \ncustomer owes additional premium. Addendum to the Proceedings OOPSLA 93 Prior to the development of \nthis system, the process of reconciling the data gathered from the field audits with the originally planned \ncoverage was done manually, with the aid of adding machines, by completers. The resulting changes would \nthen be keyed into host 3270 screens by keyers. The process was fragmented and cumbersome. The business \ngoal was to shorten processing cycle times and improve the accuracy and quality of the work products. \nThe actual development effort occurred over an elapsed time period of 12 months, of which the first three \nwere analysis and prototyping. The average staff level for the project was five members. The scheduled \ncompletion date was May 1993, but the development effort (less final testing) was not completed until \nSeptember 1993. The project could have been completed sooner, but was beset by several challenges. The \ndevelopment team s mentor was lost to the Litigation System project at the midpoint, thereby effectively \nreducing the average experience level. The team encountered deep legacy system dependencies which impeded \nprogress. There was a delay in acquiring dedicated CICUCOBOL resources to develop those segments of the \nsystem, thus impacting the workstation development teams ability to integrate and verify the interfaces \nbetween systems. The Premium Audit project suffered major staffing disruptions with two members of the \nteam leaving the company, and two members rolling off at the mid-point. Additionally, the resources used \nto backfill at the mid- point were new Smalltalkers who drew the attention from those who remained from \nthe original team, as they required guidance and mentorship. Thus the overall productivity level from \nthat point forward dropped somewhat. Also at about that time, the technical project manager left the \nproject, leaving a leadership vacuum. Perhaps most importantly, was the impact of the very nature of \nthe project. Since it was essentially exploratory in nature, it did not have the pressure that more critical \nprojects had. This allowed the project to drift from time to time. It also meant that when other crises \narose in the business area, critical resources were pulled from Premium Audit activities to support those \nefforts. Thus, there are significant risks in undertaking what would seem to be a relatively risk-less \nproject.  Litigation Management System The Litigation Management System was designed to track and manage \nthe status of litigation claims and proceedings involving owned real estate in which the Travelers was \na named party. This process had been done manually with some support from small PC systems like Paradox. \nIt is important to closely manage these cases, since oftentimes it is less costly to settle immediately \nthan to litigate a case for an extended period of time. The business objective, therefore was to increase \nthe speed and accuracy of case disposition and reduce not only processing costs, but incurred liabilities \nas well. The Litigation System development effort spanned an 1 I month time frame, but the first 4 months \nwere purely analysis. The time span from detailed specification to re- specification to delivery was \na very fast seven months. Where one of the months was entirely devoted to re- specification in response \nto the initial prototype. The average staff level on the project was only 3.5 developers and one business \nliaison/project controller. The original delivery date was set as May 1993 for Phase II. However, during \nthe re-specification study, the team committed to an August 1993 date to deliver all four planned phases. \nThus, the project development effort was nearly halved, since no additional development was required \npast August to provide full functionality. This was a significant victory for project management and \nthe development team. As a critical project, the Litigation System always had the full attention of management. \nThe requirements overhaul undertaken in April 1993 was driven by the users reacting to the system that \nwas initially specified. It required approximately 3 weeks to redesign the prototype and obtain final \nsign-off to complete development. For most projects, that requirements overhaul would have meant big \nproblems. The team realized it would be impossible to deliver the re- specified system in May, so the \nproject management team negotiated an August date that included additional functional capabilities as \nwell. This was a win-win situation that was driven by strong and effective project managers and engaged \nand empowered development team members. 4. Technical Challenges and Solutions In undertaking these two \nSmalltalk projects, we faced three significant technical challenges. An inability to meet these challenges \nwould have brought an end to any hopes of moving Smalltalk into our organization. The three challenges \nwere: integrating with legacy systems, accessing relational databases, and quickly providing a reporting \nmechanism. Integrating with Legacy Systems The legacy system integration was the most difficult challenge \nof the three. The crux of the problem is that the development team had far less control over changes, \nupdates, and access to the host system than to the workstation. Therefore, there were significant delays \ndriven by scheduled upgrades, test cycles, test data generation, and other key aspects. It was also difficult, \nsince the team had virtually no host experience and was dependent on external resources to provide much \nof what was needed. This skill void and organizational problem created countless misunderstandings and \ndelays. In an ideal world, legacy systems are best avoided, but reality dictates that we must evolve \na means of interacting successfully with them. It is true that if we cannot do this, then we will provide \nlittle added value since the business was built on these systems and they will not go away soon. Accessing \nRelational Databases Accessing relational databases was quite simple for the Litigation System. The team \nused the Synergistic Solutions Smalltalk\\SQL class library to gain access to Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, \nand the Micro Decisionware Gateway to IMS and DB/2 on the Host systems. We were fortunate in that the \nsingle class library and its intended interface to Sybase APIs was supported by all three of our target \ndata stores. This enables us to use a consistent and integrated approach to accessing and storing data. \n Simple Reporting Subsystem We needed a simple reporting mechanism that would produce quality output \nfor the Litigation System. It was clear we had no time to develop our own report writer and no vendor \nhad one available at the time. Therefore, we brainstormed for some time before arriving at a solution \nthat would utilize Microsoft Word for Windows as the formatting and printing engine. All that we had \nto do was generate a mail merge data file from Smalltalk using the system data in the database, launch \nWord and invoke the appropriate formatted template from Smalltalk to merge with the data file and presto \n- done. To create all 28 reports required less than two weeks of programming effort. 5. Leveraging Our \nExperiences As the result of our experiences to date, we have reached two significant inescapable conclusions. \nFirst, all object technology projects must be undertaken in the context of a clear and consistent overall \nvision. Second, to achieve the purported benefits associated with object technology requires a cultural \nshift in development methods and reuse management. Both of these requirements point to the need to establish \na core object technology center to drive them forward. Lessons Learned It is imperative to consult with \nexperts in object technology prior to undertaking a new project that expects to employ OT. Some gauge \nof the feasibility and appropriateness of object technology for the given proposed undertaking can help \navert disaster, or at least lackluster outcomes. New areas of the business should avoid jumping into \nobject technology development efforts without the hands-on assistance of either internal or external \nexperts. This will often only lead to development paralysis or the construction of poorly factored designs. \nThe grave danger is that the tools themselves will be used as the scapegoat and the organization will \npostpone OT adoption and lose the potential to benefit from its application The several lines of business \nat The Travelers who have committed resources to object technology have been able to avoid repeating \nmistakes made on other projects by communicating with one another through the Applied Technology Team. \nHowever, an internal organization dedicated solely to objects could provide more dependable means of \ninformation sharing and technology transfer between these business areas. Developing successful object \nsystems is currently very much a function of the individuals assigned to a given project. We have identified \nthe immediate need to adopt a methodology to structure and formalize our development efforts. Until we \nestablish a consistent approach to building systems, we will be unable to estimate and measure our performance. \nAs a result, repeatable sustainable success will be beyond our grasp. The Object Systems Center The \norganizational mechanism to help us leverage our experiences and respond to the lessons that we have \nlearned is a corporate Object Systems Center (OSC). The OSC will be established in 1994 to provide the \nservices below to the various lines of business that are interested in adopting object technology. leverage \nthe total corporate investment in object technology expedite knowledge transfer across the organization \nfacilitate corporate-wide design and development to reduce costs and cycle times while improving overall \nquality The organization of the center will be divided into two complementary sets of roles: the project \nteams and the support team. The OSC project teams will serve as mentors to the line of business areas \non whose projects they will work. The support team will be comprised of a core staff to manage those \nfunctions that are common to all business areas: reuse engineering, methodology, training, marketing, \nenvironments and tools, and overall technology strategy.  Epilog As of November 1993, the Litigation \nManagement System is now in its second incarnation. The system has been ported from Smalltalk/V PM 1.4 \nto Smalltalk V/OS2 2.0.8 and many new features have been included. On a different note, the Premium Audit \nSystem is on hold until the testing resources and host document generation developer can be freed to \nfocus on those remaining aspects of the project. There has been a stated objective to successfully integration \ntest with the legacy systems by year end. The other Smalltalk projects are moving along and are expected \nto be implemented in the first half of 1994. Now that there exists at least one Smalltalk system in production \nat the Travelers, the road has been smoothed a bit for subsequent endeavors. The remaining unknown is \nthe current organizational change underway as The Travelers (the insurance company) becomes The (New) \nTravelers (multi-line financial services company) in the wake of the merger with Primerica at year end. \nThe prospects are exciting and those of this who have come this far look to the future for new challenges \nand success.
