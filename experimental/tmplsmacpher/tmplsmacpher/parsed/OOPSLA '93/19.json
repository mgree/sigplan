C. Ting, University of Connecticut 1. Introduction Object-oriented systems are gaining increasing \npopularity due to their inherent ability to represent conceptual entities as objects, which is similar \nto the way humans view the world. This power of representation has led to the development of new generation \napplications such as Multimedia information processing, Artificial Intelligence, CAD/CAM, and Process \ncontrol systems. In addition to the power of representation, object-oriented approaches are also being \nused to design software components and to interconnect heterogeneous database systems. However, the increasing \npopularity of object-oriented systems should not obscure the need to maintain security of operation. \nThat is, it is important that such systems operate securely in order to overcome any malicious corruption \nof data as well as to prohibit unauthorized access to and use of classified data. For applications such \nas C41, it is also important to provide multilevel security. Consequently, multilevel secure object-oriented \nsystems are needed in order to ensure that users cleared to different security levels access and share \na database with data at different security levels in such a way that they obtain only the data classified \nat or below their level. Recently several research efforts have been reported on incorporating multilevel \nsecurity into object-oriented systems. In addition, much work has also been done on incorporating discretionary \nsecurity into object-oriented systems. With discretionary security, users are granted access to the objects \nbased on their identification. Many commercial products enforce some discretionary access control measures. \nWhile progress has been made on applying security to object-oriented systems, object-oriented technology \nis also being applied to design secure applications. The main focus has been on medical applications \nand multilevel secure applications. In order to promote the exchange of ideas on security for object-oriented \nsystems between the security community and object-oriented community, we organized the OOPSLA 93 Conference \nWorkshop on Security for Object-oriented Systems. The workshop addressed two aspects. First one was on \nincorporating multilevel security as well as discretionary security into 7993 Workshop  Systems object-oriented \nsystems to produce secure object- oriented systems. The second aspect was on the use of object-oriented \ndesign and modeling techniques for designing secure applications. This was the first workshop on security \nto be part of an OOPSLA Conference. Participants at this workshop were from France, Germany, Greece, \nItaly, United Kingdom, and the United States. The workshop consisted of four sessions with each session \nhaving four papers. The papers were published in the workshop proceedings and distributed at the workshop. \nFollowing the paper presentations, there was a discussion session. In this paper, we summarize the papers \npresented at the workshop and the discussions that took place. 2. Summary of the Papers The first session \nwas on applications and systems and consisted of four papers. The first paper by George Pangalos is entitled: \nIntegrating Object-Oriented Technology and Security in Medical Database Systems. It describes the application \nof object-oriented technology in the health care system and shows how this technology could help provide \nbetter security for such systems. George also described the various medical information systems that \nhave been developed in Europe. The second paper by Barry Bird is entitled: The Security Facilities of \nPCTE. It describes an existing object management system called PCTE which has several security features. \nIt was stated that PCTE has been standardized by the European Computer Manufactures Association. Mandatory \naccess control, discretionary access control, and administrative features were described by Barry. The \nthird paper by Karin Vosseberg, Peter Brossler, and J.L. Keedy is entitled: A Base for Secure Object-Oriented \nEnvironments. It describes a base protection mechanism for an object- oriented environment upon which \ndifferent security models can be constructed. In particular, the support of the specification of access \nbased on the right to invoke interface routines is discussed. The fourth paper by James (Jim) Talvitie \nis entitled: Object Model for Security System. It describes a set of roles to be played by the object \nclasses of an object-oriented Addendum to the Proceedings OOPSLA 93 security system. As stated in the \npaper, many of the ideas have been influenced by POSIX and DCE. The second session was on multilevel \nsecure systems and consisted of four papers. The first paper by N. Boulahia-Cuppens, F. Cuppens, A. Gabillon, \nand K. Yazdanian is entitled: Techniques to Handle Multilevel Objects in Secure Object-Oriented Databases. \nIt describes how multilevel entities could be supported in an object-oriented database. Two alternatives \nare proposed and mappings to single-level entities are discussed. The second paper by Sarbari Gupta is \nentitled: Object-Oriented Security in the Trusted Mach Operating Systems. It describes the object-oriented \nfeatures of the Trusted Mach (trademark of Trusted Information Systems) operating system. The essential \nfeatures of the design are the message- oriented client-server model and heavy usage of layering, modularity, \nabstraction, and information hiding. The third paper by Elisa Bertino, Sushi1 Jajodia, and Pierangela \nSamarati is entitled: Enforcing Mandatory Access Controls in Object-Oriented Databases. This paper focuses \non how multilevel entities could be modelled as single-level entities. It also describes issues on object \nupdates and secure garbage collection. The fourth paper by Ciaran Bryce is entitled: Information Flow \nControl in Object-Oriented Programs. It describes security for parallel object- oriented languages. It \nalso examines how coarse-grained policies may be expressed in the security model framework. The third \nsession was on authorization and access control and consisted of four papers. The first paper by Eduardo \nFemandez, Maria Larrondo-Petrie, and Ehud Gudes is entitled: A Method-based Authorization Model for Object-Oriented \nDatabases. It describes an authorization model for object-oriented databases where access constraints \nare defined in terms of methods. A notion called implied authorization is applied along the data hierarchy \nand a set of policies for generalization, aggregation, and relationship are developed. The second paper \nby Steven Demurjian and T. C. Ting is entitled: Shouldn t the Object-Oriented Paradigm Influence and \nGuide the Approach for Security. It argues whether one should really look at security for object-oriented \nsystems or whether the object-oriented paradigm should influence security. It favors the latter and continues \nto give reasons for it. The third paper by Ciaran Bryce is entitled: An Access Control Model for Parallel \nObject- Oriented Languages. It describes an access control model for parallel object-oriented languages. \nIn particular, the constraints that are needed for security are described and subsequently a protection \nmodel is given. The fourth paper by Elisa Bertino and Pierangela Samarati is entitled: Research Issues \nin Discretionary Authorizations for Object-Oriented Databases. It discusses the developments in discretionary \nsecurity for object-oriented systems and describes a set of research issues. In particular issues on \nadministration, propagation, and various types of authorizations are given. The fourth session was on \nmultilevel applications, systems, and issues and consisted of four papers. The first paper by Myong Kang, \nOliver Costich, and Judith Froscher is entitled: Using Object-Modeling Techniques to Design MLS Data \nModels. It describes the approach to database development and shows how Rumbaugh et. al s OMT methodology \ncould be used to generate multilevel relational database schema. The second paper by William (Bill) Hemdon \nis entitled: Can we do without Monotonically Non-decreasing Levels in Class Hierarchies? It states that \nmany of the secure object-oriented data models assume that the security classifications applied to classes \nare monotonically non-decreasing. It argues that this assumption is not really necessary and gives examples \nto support the arguments. The third paper by Roshan Thomas and Ravi Sandhu is entitled: Concurrency, \nSynchronization, and Scheduling to Support High- Assurance Write-up in Multilevel Object-based Computing. \nIt describes concurrency, synchronization, and scheduling issues that arise with the support of high \nassurance write-up actions in multilevel object-based environments. An approach is presented which closes \nchannels by executing the methods in the send and receiver objects concurrently when write-up action \nis requested. The fourth paper by Vicki Jones and Marianne Winslett is entitled: Secure Database Interoperation \nvia Role Translation. It describes an approach for translating roles between role lattices. It also states \nthat such an approach would facilitate the interoperation between secure databases.  3. Discussion In \nthe discussion that took place following the paper presentations, several issues were discussed. In particular, \na discussion of the role of security in object- oriented systems standards (such as OMG s CORBA, ANSI \nX3/H7 s work, and ODMG) and issues on integrating security and object-oriented technologies were discussed. \nOne possible approach would be to identify the various object-oriented technology areas, such as object-oriented \noperating systems, object-oriented database systems, distributed object management systems, object-oriented \nprogramming languages, and object-oriented design and analysis methodologies, and determine how security \ncould influence or benefit from these technologies. It seems that much of the work has been on incorporating \nsecurity into object-oriented database systems. The workshop also had presentations on secure object-oriented \nprogramming languages and object-oriented design and analysis methods for secure applications which showed \nmuch promise. Some efforts on secure object-oriented operating systems and secure distributed object \nmanagement systems were discussed. Following the technical discussions, suggestions for improving the \nworkshop were given by the audience for future years. One possibility would be to have smaller working \ngroups focussing on specific topics (such as secure object-oriented database systems, secure distributed \nobject management systems, and applying object-oriented design and analysis techniques for secure applications), \nand each group presenting the results at the end of the workshop. There was also much interest in continuing \nwith discussions on security for object-oriented systems, and it was suggested that a proposal be made \nto have such a workshop for the OOPSLA 94 Conference. The technical interchange at this workshop was \nfruitful and on the whole the workshop was quite successful with enthusiastic participants from different \ncountries. Washington, D.C.
