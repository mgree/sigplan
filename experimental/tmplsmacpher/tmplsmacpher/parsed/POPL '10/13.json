Henzinger IST Austria (Institute of Science \nand Technology Austria) tah@ist.ac.at Abstract Classical formalizations of systems and properties are \nboolean: given a system and a property, the property is either true or false of the system. Correspondingly, \nclassical methods for system anal\u00adysis determine the truth value of a property, preferably giving a proof \nif the property is true, and a counterexample if the property is false; classical methods for system \nsynthesis construct a system for which a property is true; classical methods for system transfor\u00admation, \ncomposition, and abstraction aim to preserve the truth of properties. The boolean view is prevalent even \nif the system, the property, or both refer to numerical quantities, such as the times or probabilities \nof events. For example, a timed automaton either sat\u00adis.es or violates a formula of a real-time logic; \na stochastic process either satis.es or violates a formula of a probabilistic logic. The classical black-and-white \nview partitions the world into correct and incorrect systems, offering few nuances. In reality, of several \nsystems that satisfy a property in the boolean sense, often some are more desirable than others, and \nof the many systems that violate a property, usually some are less objectionable than others. For instance, \namong the systems that satisfy the response property that every request be granted, we may prefer systems \nthat grant requests quickly (the quicker, the better), or we may prefer systems that issue few unnecessary \ngrants (the fewer, the better); and among the systems that violate the response property, we may prefer \nsystems that serve many initial requests (the more, the better), or we may prefer systems that serve \nmany requests in the long run (the greater the fraction of served to unserved requests, the better). \nFormally, while a boolean notion of correctness is given by a preorder on systems and properties, a quantitative \nnotion of cor\u00adrectness is de.ned by a directed metric on systems and properties, where the distance between \na system and a property provides a measure of .t or desirability. There are many ways how such distances \ncan be de.ned. In a linear-time framework, one assigns numerical values to individual behaviors before \nassigning values to systems and properties, which are sets of behaviors. For example, the value of a \nsingle behavior may be a discounted value, which is largely determined by a pre.x of the behavior, e.g., \nby the num\u00adber of requests that are granted before the .rst request that is not granted; or a limit value, \nwhich is independent of any .nite pre.x. A limit value may be an average, such as the average response \ntime over an in.nite sequence of requests and grants, or a supremum, Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). \nPOPL 10, January 17 23, 2010, Madrid, Spain.

Similarly, the value of a set of behaviors may be an extremum or an average across the values of \nall behaviors in the set: in this way one can measure the worst of all possible average-case response \ntimes, or the average of all possible worst-case response times, etc. Accordingly, the distance between \ntwo sets of behaviors may be de.ned as the worst or aver\u00adage difference between the values of corresponding \nbehaviors. In summary, we propagate replacing boolean speci.cations for the correctness of systems with \nquantitative measures for the desir\u00adability of systems. In quantitative analysis, the aim is to compute \nthe distance between a system and a property (or between two sys\u00adtems, or two properties); in quantitative \nsynthesis, the objective is to construct a system that has minimal distance from a given prop\u00aderty. Multiple \nquantitative measures can be prioritized (e.g., com\u00adbined lexicographically into a single measure) or \nstudied along the Pareto curve. Quantitative transformations, compositions, and ab\u00adstractions of systems \nare useful if they allow us to bound the in\u00adduced change in distance from a property. We present some \ninitial results in some of these directions. We also give some potential ap\u00adplications, which not only \ngeneralize tradiditional correctness con\u00adcerns in the functional, timed, and probabilistic domains, but \nalso capture such system measures as resource use, performance, cost, reliability, and robustness.
