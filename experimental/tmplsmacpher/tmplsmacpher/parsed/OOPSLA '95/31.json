These workshops have been developed to provide members of such \norganizations a forum to discuss their respective efforts to establish OTCs and techniques they use in \npromoting the effective use of object technology in their organizations. The current workshop was the \nthird annual OOPSLA workshop on the Role of a Corporate Object Technology Center in the continuing series \nof such workshops and was held on October 15, 1995 at Austin, Texas. The workshop followed and was influenced \nby the issues raised in the first Conference on Object Technology Centers held in April 1995 in Stone \nMountain, Georgia. This year s workshop consisted of 21 participants from 14 organizations. In addition \nto presentations on the topics of OTC Organization, Methods, Effective Organization for Leveraging OT, \nand Paradigms, the workshop conducted working sessions on Sharing Applied Research, Organization and \nParadigm Shift Issues, and OTC Support Services. 1.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION (Moderator: Vijay Vaishnavi) Vijay discussed the general goals of the continuing \nseries of the OOPSLA workshops which were . to continue the process of establishing a mature experience-based \nunderstanding of effective goals, structure, and roles for a corporate object technology center, and \n. to be a forum were OTCs could continue to share information and collaborate on particular topics of \ninterest. The unprioritized specific goals of the workshop were . to know the participants and to develop \nprofessional relationships, . to participate in shared experience, . to produce useful output on topics \nof comm on interest, . to collectively undergo stimulation and growth from synthesis of ideas, . to get \na better understanding of the appli ed research issues and support services of interest to OTCs, and \n. to get a better understanding of Comsoft that attempts to fulfill these needs.  4. INTRODUCTIONS: \nParticipants and Comsoft (Moderator: Timothy Korson) Tim moderated the introductions of the participants \nand provided an overview of the current role being played by Comsoft as an OTC of OTCs. Each participant \nprovided enough background and contextual information to make this session useful for getting to know \neach other.  5. PRESENTATIONS (Moderators: Rick Foster and Marykay Wells) The position papers were presented \non the following topics: OTC Organization, Methods, Effective Organization for Leveraging OT, and Paradigms. \nOn each topic, the presenters provided a list of what works and what does not work. 5.1 OTC Organization \nNorthern Telecom (Michael Crooks and Marykay Wells; presented by Marykay Wells): What Works: --Dynamic \nteam based approach --Standardizing processes --Using the funding strategy of both core (strategic) and \ncustomer funding --Being customer focused rather than product focused (making sure that one is ready \nand doing what the customer wants) What Doesn t Work: --Dependency on executive commitment --Focusing \nsolely on tools and technology, ignoring processes --Assuming that building with 00 is the same as building \nfor reuse --Trying to move all the developers to 00 (Some are not willing or ready to move.) Entergy \nServices, Inc. (David Curry; presented by David Curry): What Works: --Management commitment --Management \nof expectations --Service orientation --Continuous improvement through Quality Process: Plan, Do, Check, \nAdjust --Learn from experts, e.g. Comsoft and experienced OTCs What Doesn t Work: --Making too fast a \ntransition to 00 --Hyping potential benefits first --Thinking that 00 = Reuse in the first year --Being \nan ivory tower --Management support instead of commitment  IBM (Allan Dickson, Tom Guinane, and Geoff \nHasmbrick; presented by Allan Dickson): What Works: --Balance serving development organizations with \nserving executives --Collect consensus when possible, avoiding driving standards into development organizations \n--Accept turnover, but try to lose people into inside development groups rather than outside groups --Pound \nthe evolutionary rather than the revolutionary model into everyone s minds --Help organizations balance \nseed versus feed use of skills --Produce documents to capture experience during any slack What Doesn \nt Work: --Ivory groups setting standards for metrics and trying to get the development groups to make \ncommitments to those metrics and to stay committed --Language and methodology standards enforced by a \ntechnology support group support for reuse at a corporate level separate from support for 00 5.2 METHODS \n Microsoft (J P. Thompson; presented by J. P. Thompson): What Works: --Develop architectures (you will \nfail if you don t) --Projects must be aligned with objects/components development --OOA matters use components \nand OLE as well as objects --Develop pilot projects, preferably successfully What Doesn t Work: --Being \nan ivory tower --Training without practice --Using 00 for developing DSS --Unsupported CASE The Prudential \nInsurance Company of America (Xin shu; presented by Xin Shu): What Works: --Create domain models for \nyour application domain -_ identify the design problems in your application domain and specify them clearly \n--Collect design solutions (design patterns, rules-of-thumb, etc.) for your design problems 188 Austin, \n 5.3 Effective Organization for Leveraging Object Technology The Vanguard Group (Thomas R. Marzolf; \npresented by Thomas R. Marzolfl: What Works: --Specifically charter someone to build, own, and manage \ncomponents --Object technology, in general; Smalltalk, in particular What Doesn t Work: --Traditional \napplication projects building enterprise- wide components. Ascom Nexion (Bob Rose; presented by Bob \nRose): What Works: --Teach by example --Education --Integration with development --Strong core team - \ncritical mass --Lots of mentoring What Doesn t Work: --Mandate/dictate object use --Hands-off advice \n--Concentrate on a particular modeling paradigm --Concentrate on a particular implementation language \n--Ignore reusability and concentrate totally on applications  5.4 Paradigms AT&#38;T (Patrick Helmers \nand Jane1 Green; presented by Patrick Helmers): What works: --Educate everyone with OOT --Only apply \nOOT if there is a reasonable schedule TX October 1519,199s --Only apply OOT if the entire team is motivated \nfor change --Find a champion for 00 who will own the vision --Only apply OOT to projects that could leverage \non code reuse, or are loosely coupled to old legacy systems, or are new starts --Employ consulting to \nbootstrap projects What Doesn t Work: --Treat OOT as the ends, not the means to the ends --Assume that \nany one method will work for your organization without customizing the method to fit your requirements \n--Assume that object-oriented technology transfer is easy and fast; actually it is very slow --Assume \nthat you can do OOT without a vision that the entire organization embraces  ObjectSpace, Inc. (Luke \nHohmann; presented by Luke Hohmann): What Works: --Catalyze the change --Counsel through the crisis --Provide \nnumerous kinds of structures --Monitor progress through measurement --Promote object technology as a \nstrategic change --Encourage reinvention within individual teams --Emphasize the cultural changes that \nsupport reuse What Doesn t Work: --Alternate between objects and non-objects --Change the development \nprocess without changing the structure that supports the process  6. Break-Out Working Sessions (Moderator: \nJared Bruckner) 6.1 Sharing Applied Research: Leveraging shared Resources Output: Applied Research Topics \nthat OTCs Share in Common (in order of priority): 1. Identifying design patterns for solving performance \nproblems 2. Mapping 00 problem domains, their implications, and connections  2. Testing frameworks \nand their requirements on objects 3. Exploring how to combine architectures, project organization, methods, \nand techniques successfully for a software organization 4. Study of characteristics of reuse in an existing \nlarge reuse marketplace 5. Evaluation of organizations for implementing 00  5. Defining what 00 skills \nand traits are needed and how to find/develop them 5. Exploring implications of different styles of reuse \n5. Frameworks for expressing 00 costs 6. How to get an architecture down to details  6. Problem of \ndomain specific testing recommendations 7. Recommendations on how to make predictions from metrics \n  6.2 Organizational and Paradigm Shift Issues: Managing for Culture Shock Output: Consensus Statement \nDue to the increasing rate of change in business, we must extend the culture surrounding software development \nfrom building systems that work to business solutions that are adaptable to change. Adopting OT is a \nmndamental organizational change, i.t WILL NOT OCCUR. The role of the OTC is that of a change agent that: \n1. Provides a model of the desired OT culture 2. Proactively seeks to change culture by bringing members \nof the technical staff into personal interaction with agents of change (e.g., consultants, mentors, educators) \n 3. Establishes policies, procedures, standards, and processes that support the desired culture  The \nend result is the institutionalization of the conference will span three days; further information on \nstructures, processes, and outcomes that enable long- submission of papers for the conference and term \nsuccess with OT. registration information is available via e-mail at info@comsofi.southem.edu or on the \nweb at www.comsoft.southem.edu.  7. General Working Session: OTC Support Services (Moderator: Dalton \nThe workshop ended with a vote of thanks. Athey) Support Services that OTCs Would Find Beneficial: 1. \nInterface between OTCs Workshops/Conferences Moderated Newsgroups/Bulletin Boards Speaker Referral Hosting \nShared research 2. Skill Certification 3. Newsletter/Web pages 4. Recruiting Assistance 5. Interdisciplinary \nStuff 6. Live on-line Conferences  8. Workgroup Presentations and Discussion (Moderator: Vijay Vaishnavi) \nThe outputs listed above were presented and discussed. 9. Wrap-up and Closing Discussions (Moderator: \nTimothy Korson) The specific goals set at the start of the workshop were reviewed to find whether the \nworkshop met the goals. There was a general agreement that the workshop was a success in achieving these \ngoals including that of getting a better appreciation of the work being done by Comsoft -- the OTC of \nOTCs. There was a general interest in continuing the yearly workshop and a conference in-between. It \nwas announced that the Second yearly conference on Object Technology Centers will be held in the Stone \nMountain Park Inn at Stone Mountain, Georgia between May 1-3, 1996.
