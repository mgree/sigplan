Ting, University of Connecticut 1.0 Introduction This report describes \nthe OOPSLA 95 Workshop on Object-Oriented Technology for Health Care and Medical Information Systems \nheld on 15 October 1995 in Austin, Texas. Mamdouh Ibrahim of Electronic Data Systems kicked-off the workshop \nby discussing what was accomplished in last years workshop. He noted the quality of the papers submitted \nto this workshop has increased significantly from last year. Shail Arora of St. John Health System in \nDetroit gave a talk on The HeaZth Care Continuum. The workshop consisted of four sessions: Distributed \nObject Technology for Health Care (Chaired by Shail Arora), Infrastructure for Next Generation Health \nCare Systems (Chaired by Mamdouh Ibrahim), Object-Oriented Technology for Clinical Settings and Services \n(Chaired by Bhavani Thurasingham and Robert Case), and Pathways and Outcomes (Chaired by Shail Arora). \nThe workshop ended with a discussion session moderated by Bhavani Thurasingham. Eighteen participants \nattended the workshop. The purpose of the workshop was to explore the potential of using object technology \nin solving the problems facing existing health care and medical information systems. It also served as \na vehicle to  by Shail Arora report on current and future efforts to develop innovative object-oriented \napplications in this area. The focus of the workshop was on specific areas that could benefit from object-oriented \ntechnology, which include: electronic medical record, integrated clinical communications, community health \ninformation networks, common person identifier, outcomes and utilization review. 2.0 Summary of the Workshop \nAfter the introduction Shail Arora of St. John Health System focused on the need for clinical, financial, \nand managed care information throughout the health care continuum. Arora described the health care continuum \nin terms of entry/service points for a given person at a health care setting (including home; church, \nor school). He posed a challenge to vendors that are developing solutions to move away from building \nlarge acute care systems to component based distributed systems. Arora discussed technology issues related \nto capturing and making available patient information throughout the continuum of care. The following \nsuccess criteria to the health care continuum were presented: . Data collection on populations not just \npatients . Data capture at all points of encounter . Utilization of a common format or standard . Mandate \ndata sharing . Availability of data at all points in the continuum SESSION 1: Distributed Object Technology \nfor Health Care Addendum to the Procerdings OOPSLA 95 Shail Arora introduced this session with a discussion \non an architecture that utilizes Mobile Objects, Object Servers, and Application De-homogenization. With \nMobile Objects Arora foresees a day when information associated with a patient moves as the patient moves \nwithin the continuum (smart cards to distributed object databases). He discussed how Object Servers for \nsuch things as Patient, Physician, and a Common Person Identifier can be utilized. According to Arora, \nhomogenous systems are from days of past; new applications should focus on a single activity (i.e., Applet). \nRobert Seliger, of Hewlett Packard, provided an introduction to the Health Level 7 Standard (HL/7) and \nit s relationship to the work of OMG. The HL/7 standard is intended to facilitate the exchange of data \nbetween independently developed health care computer applications. Utilization of HL/7 standard eliminates \nor minimizes the number of custom interfaces required to realize inter-application communication. Seliger \nsuggested that there is an opportunity to marry the what which HL/7 specifies with the How that object \ntechnology can provide. Klaus Krauter, of Continental Health Care Systems. discussed the creation of \nstandard object models for health care, which are used across different health care applications in large \nmulti-vendor integrated health information networks. He noted that it is very difficult to define a single \nstandard object oriented model because there are differences in representation and behavior of common \ndomain objects. Krauter then went on to propose a need for a set of Common Reference Models which are \norganized by application focus areas. SESSION 2: Infrastructure for Next Generation Health Care Systems \nMamdouh Ibrahim, of Electronic Data Systems, introduced the concept of Health Care Infrastructures. He \nindicated that in order to satisfy the need to capture and share information throughout the Health Care \nContinuum much emphasis needs to be placed on developing a comprehensive infrastructure on which services \ncan be supported. Subhash B. Tantry. of Andersen Consulting, presented their Healthcare Information Infrastructure \n(HII). HI1 will support the next generation of health care systems based on managed care and direct consumer \ninvolvement. He discussed the 4 HII architecture principles. He noted that the architecture must be: \nheterogeneous: open; distributed; and evolveable. The architecture relies on the Common Object Request \nBroker Architecture (CORBA) and the Common Object Services Specification (COSS) as the underlying standards \nthat will achieve the HII goals. V. Jagannathan, of West Virginia University. discussed the work conducted \nat the university and its health care partners in the area of Collaboration. Jagannathan stated that \nCollaboration is characterized by cooperative activities by health care providers to deliver total and \nreal-time care for patients. Communication between providers, and managed access to distributed patient \nrecords should enable health care providers to make informed decisions about their patients in a timely \nmanner. With an effective medical information infrastructure in place, a patient will be able to visit \nany health care provider with access to the network, and the provider will be able to use relevant information \nfrom the last episode of care in the patient record. The technologies utilized include: HTTP protocol \nfor client-end interoperability; CORBA compliant ORB; Internally developed Web technology to bridge HTTP \nand CORBA environments; Gateways to a relational database; Kerberos for authentication; and Mosaic for \nclient interface. Robert c. Lyng, of Health Systems Integration, focused his discussion on integration \nissues facing Community Health Information Networks. He outlined a need for a flexible middle-ware infrastructure \nthat allows for scaleable distribution of objects as well as integration of disparate applications. Lyng \ndiscussed that scaleable distributed applications require persistence, security, transaction management, \nmessage queuing, and network management services. SESSION 3: Object-Oriented Technology for Clinical \nSettings and Services Bhavani Thurasingham, of The Mitre Corporation, introduced this session by discussing \nsome of the key issues associated with Clinical Settings and Services. These include: confidentiality, \nsecurity, usability, performance, and scaleability. Bernard Horan, of JP Morgan, discussed two projects \nthat were a response to the information needs of British General Practitioners during the doctor-patient \nconsultation. The aim of the Practitioners Entering Notes (PEN) project was to prototype novel data-entry \nuser interfaces for use in a consulting room environment. One of the main disadvantages of current computer \nsystems designed for such use is that they encourage the recording of overly terse notes. The PEN project \ncaptures this information in one or two lines for each consuhation. Horan discussed how the PEN project \novercame these constraints. Conversely. the Practitioners Accessing Data (PAD) project was concerned \nwith the presentation of clinical data during brief consultation between the doctor and the patient. \nHoran also discussed the User Centered Design approach that was utilized. The PEN &#38; PAD projects \nconsidered the human computer environment in which a system is used. rather than concentrating on the \ndevelopment of a human computer interface . Eric Harper, of IBM, presented an experience report of an \nObject-Oriented client/server project for a Blue Cross Blue Shield organization. The project relied heavily \non Rapid Application Development techniques. This allowed the team to learn very early in the project \nthat a two-tier architecture would not have met the needs of the system, instead a three-tiered architecture \nwas selected. SESSION 4: Pathways and Outcomes Shail Arora introduced the topic of Pathways and Health \ncare Outcomes. Pathways can generally be defined as setting a standard path of care. They are sometimes \nnegatively equated to cookbook medicine, one of the reasons health care providers are devoting energy \non pathways is to eliminate duplicate tests (which increase cost and lower patient satisfaction). In \nmany ways, outcomes are being driven by the purchasers of services (i.e.. employers). William Foote, \nof Medicus Systems, discussed the use of object technology to create Pathways. He defined a pathway as \na prescription for a series of services that should be rendered to a patient who has a given medical \ncondition. Pathways help in clinical settings and are used as a tool for utilization review. In a clinical \nsetting, the pathway acts as a road-map for what should happen. When used for utilization review. a pathway \nbecomes a standard for what should have happened. Foote stated that developing these pathways is very \ntime consuming and expensive. His recommendation is to develop pathways that are reusable. specifically \nutilizing object technology to facilitate the reuse. Wes Price, of First Principles, introduced to Health \nCare Outcomes, which he defines as measuring the efficacy of medical treatments on a patients well being. \nHe discussed the work his company is doing with other partners in the creation of an Healthcare Outcomes \nSystem that utilizes an extensible semantic model. The system is in a prototype state with about 100.000 \npatient records.  3. Summary of Discussions At last years (1994) workshop the issues that were hot were \nSecurity. Clinical Patient Records. Database Technology (relational vs. object), and programming languages. \nThis year (1995) the issues that were hot included: Healthcare standards; HL/7 vs. OMG; Infrastructure \n(CORBA, OLE, Agents); Object Models; Pathways/Outcomes; Support for the full health care continuum; Information \nownership and management; Scaleability of architectures. Much of the focus this year was on building \na good understanding of the changes going-on in health care. Even the technology discussions stayed away \nfrom discussions of languages and databases and focused more on standards and architectures. Addendum \nto the Prowdings OOPSLA 95 4. Future Directions All the participants were interested in continuing the \nworkshop next year. They also decided to continue the informal discussions that were started as a result \nof last years workshop. A specific task each participant agreed to do was to advance the use of Object \nTechnology in health care (where it made sense). In order to accomplish this, a set of objectives were \ndefined: . Identify the value systems in health care . Develop a common health care object model . Develop \nstandards for system-to-system integration . Encourage the development of component based systems Progress \non these will be an agenda item next year. For further information contact Shail Arora.
