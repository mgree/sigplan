The four mentors included Mary Loomis from Hewlett-Packard \nLaboratories, John McGregor from Clemson University, Eliot Moss from the University of Massachusetts, \nand Satoshi Matsuoka from the University of Tokyo. Each student was given a 45minute slot, with 20 minutes \nallotted to presentation of the dissertation project, and the remainder to questions and critique. The \nmentors were assigned to individual students, and served as discussants, initiating the post-presentation \ncomments. The critique addressed technical aspects of the research as well as the style and organization \nof the presentation itself. The Symposium included the following students: Harumi Anne Kuno, University \nof Michigan View Management Issues in Object-oriented Databases Views are an established technique for \nrestructuring and repartitioning the format of data, classes, and schemata so that applications can customize \nshared data, even adding new extrinsic properties, without affecting the shared data. MultiView is one \nof the first OODB systems to support dynamic and updatable materialized object-oriented database views. \nDiscussant: Mary Loomis  Michael VanHilst , University of Washington A Factor-based Approach to Extensible \nObject-oriented Development We propose an approach to object-oriented development for producing more \neasily extensible code, while using only existing language mechanisms. The key to this approach is the \nuse of generic factors which are composed in a separate specification to form the structure and concrete \nclasses of the implementation. Discussant: Eliot Moss Letha Hughes Etzkorn, University of Alabama A \nMetrics-based Approach to the Automated Identification of Object-oriented Reusable Components The identification \nof reusable code within legacy code traditionally has focused on functionally-decomposed code. Though \nobject-oriented code is inherently more reusable, often reuse was not considered during development. \nA knowledge-based approach that makes preparing existing object-oriented code for reuse significantly \neasier and more quantifiable is described. Discussant: John McGregor Linda Keszenheimer, Northeastern \nUniversity Testing Adaptive Object-oriented Software Class evolution has significant impact on the testing \nand maintenance of object-oriented programs. A framework is presented for testing and maintaining software \nduring structurally-motivated and behaviorally-motivated transformations. The approach reduces the effort \nfor testing pattern-oriented components as they are reused with many different class structures. Discussant: \nJohn McGregor  Jamshed N. Patel, Purdue University Library-based Algorithm Prototyping Environment for \nComputer Vision and Image Processing on Parallel Computers Addendum to the Proceedings OOPSLA 95 We \npropose Cloner, an object-oriented environment for prototyping computer vision and image processing (CVIP) \ntasks on parallel computers. It is being designed to allow users to take advantage of the computing power \nprovided by parallel processing systems without requiring an extensive understanding of the underlying \narchitecture. Cloner is a software reuse tool that helps a user design parallel algorithms by building \non and modifying algorithms that already exist in an overall system library. Discussant: Satoshi Matsuoka \nCharles D. Norton, Rensselaer Polytechnic  Institute Object-oriented Runtime Support for Dynamically \nIrregular Parallel Computation in Plasma Modeling We introduce an Object Oriented Programming Paradigm \nto dynamically improve the efficiency of irregular parallel computations. The framework integrates application \nperformance monitoring with dynamic load balancing techniques implicitly into the programming process. \nOur research is applied to scientific computations, such as problems in computational plasma physics, \nas part of the NASA/JPL HPCC Earth and Space Sciences Project Discussant: Satoshi Matsuoka Wayne J. \nStaats, North Carolina State University WOOD -A C++ Parallelizer We present WOOD, a C++ parallelizer, \nwhich extends the parallelizing transformation introduced by Yin, Bin, and Ungerer [20] to extract more \ninter and intra object parallelism and overcomes implementation difficulties with their proposal. We \nalso present a mathematical model based on Milner s SCCS [ 161 which will be used to extend our parallelizing \ncompiler by simulating certain aspects of the object oriented program as its being parallelized. The \ninformation gained from the simulation will be used by WOOD to make partitioning decision to help produce \nfewer and faster parallel processes. Discussant: John McGregor Adriana Lopes Diaz, Carleton University \nAn Object-oriented Reflective Simulation Environment for Distributed Algorithms This thesis is an attempt \nto find applications for object- oriented reflection in providing a new approach to the simulation of \ndistributed algorithms. The object-oriented concurrent reflective language ABCL/R2 is used to illustrate \nthe simulation of some distributed algorithms. Discussant: Eliot Moss Siva Challa, Virginia Tech A Framework \nUsing Reflection for Interoperability of Statically Typed Object-oriented Languages The major goal of \nthis dissertation is to design and implement an Interoperable Common Object Model (ICOM) that facilitates \ninteroperability among statically typed object-oriented languages (in a distributed, heterogeneous environment). \nThe model will be realized by an implementation framework developed in C++, Modula-3, and Eiffel. A new \nreflection technique has been developed for uniform mapping of the features of the common object model \non to the selected languages. Discussant: Mary Loomis K. Kishore Dhara, Iowa State University Behavioral \nSubtyping in Object-oriented Languages Behavioral subtyping is studied as a tool for modular verification \nof 00 programs. We propose two notions of behavioral subtyping in the context of mutation and aliasing. \nThe weaker form of behavioral subtyping allows more subtypes while limiting certain kinds of abasing. \nThese alias restrictions can be checked statically. Both behavioral subtype notions are adequate for \nsound and modular verification. Discussant: Eliot Moss Austin.
