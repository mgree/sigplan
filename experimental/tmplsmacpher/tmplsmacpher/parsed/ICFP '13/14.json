Over the last two decades, computing at school has drifted from writing adventure games on the BBC \nMicro to writing business plans in Excel. This is bad for our young people s education, and it is bad \nfor our economy. Nor is this phenomenon restricted to the UK: many countries are struggling with the \nsame issues. Our young people should be educated not only in the application and use of digital technology, \nbut also in how it works, and its foundational principles. Lacking such knowledge renders them powerless \nin the face of complex and opaque technology, disenfranchises them from making informed decisions about \nthe digital society, and deprives our nations of a well-quali.ed stream of students enthusiastic and \nable to envision and design new digital systems. Can anything be done, given the enormous inertia of \nour various countries educational systems? Sometimes, yes. After a decade of stasis, change has come \nto the UK. Over the last 18 months, there has been a wholesale reform of the English school computing \ncurriculum, and substantial movement in Scotland and Wales. It now seems likely that computer science \nwill, for the .rst time, become part of every child s education.
