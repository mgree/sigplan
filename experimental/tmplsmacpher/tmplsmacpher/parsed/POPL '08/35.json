But \nnow we know that few, if any, molecular signaling pathways are standalone entities. The cell resembles \na combinato\u00adriallyexcitable medium morethana hardwiredchip.Overhere,we are tracking genetic diversity \nat the single nucleotide level and soon human genomes will be sequenced over night for less than the \ncost of a transatlantic airline ticket. Over there is the promise of cur\u00ading hideous disease, the potential \nof turning the molecular biology toolboxintoaliving technology,andthespellofproviding answers to Big \nQuestions: What is a cell thinking ? What does it mean to be evolvable ?Inthe middleofitallisabiggaping \nhole. Genome dataisverypowerful for identifying disease,but the genomeis not the level at which we intervene \nto cure disease. To cure disease, we must engage with the dynamical systems of protein interactions that \nconspire with the genome in generating phenotype. The loose collection of wide-ranging efforts to .ll \nthisgap is called systems biology. Models will play an important role in this effort. They will be vehicles \nfor the organization, storage and communication of rapidly evolving knowledge, the design of experiments, \nand a deeper understanding of biology. We believe it is essential that models play a double role in sys\u00adtems \nbiology. First, a model should be a datastructure that contains a transparent, formal, andexecutable \nrepresentationof thefactsit rests upon. In our case, thesefacts are about molecular interaction mechanisms.Amodel \nshouldbeanenvironmentinwhichdatathat is about interaction actually interacts. Second, a model must be \nequipped with analytical tools for revealing the causal structures re\u00adsulting fromaparticular systemoffacts. \nThese structures shapedy\u00adnamics in non-intuitive ways. Such a notion of model differs from common practiceinphysics.Infact,it \nresembles much more the notionofaprogramin computer science.Ifso,then modelingisnot unlike programming. \nConversely, if a program is to be a biological model, it cannot be written in an arbitrary language. \nThe analysis (static and otherwise) of the program must reveal, not obfuscate, the causal mechanisms \nthat constrain the dynamics of the system it represents. Our approachistoexpressfacts(orhypotheses) about \nmolecular agents in a formal language, effectively turning empir\u00adical data directly into instructions.We \nhave recently implemented a platform (Danos et al 2007) for de.ning and analyzing concur\u00adrent models \nof combinatorially complex signaling systems based on a dialect of Kappa, a formalism with clear appeal \nto biologists, originally proposedbyVincent Danos and Cosimo Laneve (Danos and Laneve 2004). The rule-centric \nnature of Kappa analogous to reaction schemes in organic chemistry curbs the combinato\u00adrial explosion \nthat wipes out traditional kinetic approaches based on differential equations or their stochastic Petri \nNet counterparts. The reduction of concepts from concurrencyto biological practice is neither simple \nto implement nor easy for biologists to grasp. It deals with unfamiliar concepts, whose clari.cation \ntookalong time even within their domain of origin. In particular,we adapted the no\u00adtionofanevent structure \n(NielsenandWinskel1995)to formalize the intuitivenotion biologistsholdofa pathwaytoan observable . Techniques \nfrom abstract interpretation (Cousot and Cousot 1977; Danos et al 2008) are deployed to generate all \nlocal views of molecular entities made possible by a given set of rules, as well as to generate maps \nthat depict causal and con.ictual relationships be\u00adtween rules. These maps,in juxtaposition with speci.cevent \nstruc\u00adtures, can be used to understand system dynamics. We have im\u00adplemented a fully scalable continuous-time \nMonte Carlo execution schedule (Gillespie simulator) (Danos et al 2007b) for generating and sampling \ntraces in accordance with standard stochastic chem\u00adical reaction kinetics. This suite of techniques is \nbeing tested in collaboration with laboratories to elucidate large cellular decision systems. Future \nchallenges call for extensions of the language to express additional physical aspects, such as geometric \nproperties of agents and topological properties of reaction media (e.g. com\u00adpartments), without losing \nformality and analytical capabilities.
