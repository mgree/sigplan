The crucial insights, both due to Moggi (6; 7), are: (i) that manykindsofeffect canbe \nencapsulated semanticallybythe math\u00adematical notion of strong monad;and (ii) that a general.-calculus \nfor effects, the computational metalanguage, can be based on this. In a 1996 paper (1), Benton and Wadler \nobserve that there is considerable overlap between Moggi s computational metalan\u00adguage, and Girard s \nintuitionistic linear logic (3). On the semantic side, models of intuitionistic linear logic always induce \nstrong mon\u00adads on a cartesian-closed category, and so also provide models of Moggi s language. On the \nsyntactic side, different translations of typed .-calculus into Moggi s metalanguage (e.g., call-by-name, \ncall-by-value) correspond to different interpretations of intuitionis\u00adtic logic in linear logic. However, \nBenton andWadler also observe that there are mis\u00admatches between the two worlds. In particular, the models \nof Moggi s computational metalanguage that arise from models of linear logic are very special ones: their \nstrong monads are always commutative. Computationally, commutativity corresponds to ef\u00adfects not being \naffected by their order of invocation. This is a very Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).

Accordingly, Benton and Wadler ask \nthe natural question of whether it is possible to modify linear logic, retaining much of its expressivity, \nin such a way that an exact cor\u00adrespondence with the computational metalanguage is achieved. In this \ntalk,Ishall presentavariation on intuitionistic linear logic, the enriched effect-calculus, that enjoys \nsuch a correspondence. Thus Benton andWadler s questionis answeredin the positive. The principal envisaged \narea of application, for the enriched effect-calculus, is to situations in which there are crucial interac\u00adtions \nbetween linearity and effects. For example, in computation with side effects, the manipulation of state \nis (usually) linear in the sense that anymodi.cation to the state overwrites the current state, which \nis then non-recoverable (i.e., there is no possibility of snapback ), see (4).A second classofexamplesisgivenby \nthe manystructured forms of control that use their continuations in a linearfashion, see(2).Athirdexampleis \nnondeterministic compu\u00adtation, where typically each nondeterministic choice is made once and for all: \nthe computation does not subsequently backtrack and explore other choices. Another, surprising, situation \nin which the presence of linear primitives proves useful is in developing a the\u00adory of relational parametricity \nfor polymorphism in combination with computational effects, see (5). The main aim of the talk is to motivate \nand present the enriched effect-calculus through its application to computationally interest\u00ading examples. \nThe focus will be on syntactic and computational aspects, with the categorical model theory being left \nin the back\u00adground.However,if time permits,Iwill brie.yexplainhowevery model has a dual, and how a generic \nlinear continuation-passing transform arises as the unique structure-preserving functor from the free \nmodel to its dual.
