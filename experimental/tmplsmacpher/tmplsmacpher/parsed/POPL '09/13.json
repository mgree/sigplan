Taking a computational point of view, \nthere are many natural language expressions operators in the wild, so to speak that control evaluation \nin ways that are familiar from programming languages: just think of the natural-language counterparts \nof if, unless, while, etc. But in general, how well-behaved are control operators found in the wild? \nCan we always understand them in terms of familiar programming constructs, or do they go signi.\u00adcantly \nbeyond the expressive power of programming languages? As an example where operators from a programming \nlanguage can provide an insightful analysis of a natural language construc\u00adtion, consider the difference \nin meaning between the following two sentences: (1) a. John only drinks PERRIER. (emphasis on Perrier) \nb. John only DRINKS Perrier. (emphasis on drinks) The .rst sentence entails that John never drinks, say, \nEvian, but the second sentence entails instead that John never does anything (relevant) with Perrier \nexcept drink it. I will suggest that we can understand this difference by expressing the meanings of \nthese sen\u00adtences in terms of Sitaram s fcontrol and run operators (variants on throw and catch). But \nnot all wild operators are so easily captured. I will discuss in some detail the meaning of the word \nsame in English as it occurs in the following sentence: (2) John and Bill read the same book. This sentence \nhas a prominent interpretation on which it means (roughly) there is some book x such that John read x \nand Bill read x . I provide a preliminary analysis based on Danvy and Filinski s shift and reset. However, \nthe shift/reset approach does not generalize to the full range of related sentences in English. I give \na more general solution expressed in a Type Logical Grammar (a certain kind of substructural logic) with \nexplicit continuations. But even this is inadequate: I go on to discuss additional, only slightly less \nordinary uses of same that remain untamed by any known compositional semantics.
