First, it describes a &#8220;macro-by-example&#8221; specification language for syntactic abstractions in Lisp and related languages. This specification language allows a more declarative specification of macros than conventional macro facilities do by giving a better treatment of iteration and mapping constructs. Second, it gives a formal semantics for the language and a derivation of a compiler from the semantics. This derivation is a practical application of semantics-directed compiler development methodology.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "E. E.
