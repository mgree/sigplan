This semantics turns termination, communication along channels, and the time communication takes place, into observables. Yet it is the coarsest semantics to do so which is syntax-directed (this is known as full abstraction). It extends the linear history semantics for CSP of Francez, Lehman and Pnueli. Our execution model is based on maximizing concurrent activity as opposed to interleaving (in which only one action occurs at the time and arbitrary delays are incurred between actions). It is a variant of the maximal parallelism model of Salwicki and M&#252;ldner.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "C.
