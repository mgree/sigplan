Extensions to achieve completeness are generally complicated and cumbersome. In this paper, a simple trace logic is defined and two examples are presented to show its inherent incompleteness. Surprisingly, both examples consist of only one process, indicating that network composition is not a cause of incompleteness. Axioms necessary and sufficient for the relative completeness of a trace logic are then presented.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "J.
