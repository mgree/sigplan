For each model, we define three kinds of algebraic operations on processes: the <italic>product</italic> operation, <italic>abstraction</italic> operations, and <italic>connection</italic> operations. We obtain homomorphic mappings, from input/output automata to labeled processes, and from a subalgebra (called &#8220;input/output processes&#8221;) of labeled processes to Kahn functions. The proof that the latter mapping preserves connection operations amounts to a new proof of the &#8220;Kahn Principle.&#8221; Our approach yields: (1) extremely simple definitions of the process operations; (2) a simple and natural proof of the Kahn Principle that does not require the use of &#8220;strategies&#8221; or &#8220;scheduling arguments&#8221;; (3) a semantic characterization of a large class of labeled processes for which the Kahn Principle is valid, (4) a convenient operational semantics for nondeterminate process networks.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "E.
