Stanley Evolutionary \nComplexity Research Group Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science University of Central \nFlorida Orlando, FL USA kstanley@eecs.ucf.edu Abstract Someday computer scientists may build systems \nof astronomical complexity that provide profound benefit to humanity. However, the question today is \nhow such feats will ultimately be achieved. As is common with technology, present limitations to modern \napproaches challenge our imagination to search for new paradigms and organizing principles. To examine \nthe prerequisites to achieving our most ambitious objectives, this talk will contemplate the implications \nof recent counterintuitive results from experiments with evolutionary algorithms that suggest that search \n(which is a metaphor for innovation in general) is sometimes most effective when it is not explicitly \nseeking an objective. In particular, through several experiments in interactive evolution and with an \nalgorithm called novelty search, a picture of innovation is emerging in which objectives can help to \nguide us one stepping\u00adstone away from our present understanding, yet ultimately become handcuffs that \nalso blind us to essential orthogonal discoveries on the road to long-term innovation. While the implications \nof these insights for reaching our highest goals are in part sobering, the silver lining is that much \ncan be gained by liberating ourselves from the temptation to frame all our projects in terms of what \nthey ultimately aim to achieve. Instead, with evidence in hand, we can exploit the structure of the unknown \nby orienting ourselves towards discovery and away from the shackles of mandated outcomes.

[Artificial \nIntelligence]: Learning General Terms: Algorithms, Management, Design, Experimentation Bio Kenneth O. \nStanley is an assistant professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the \nUniversity of Central Florida. He received a B.S.E. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1997 and received \na Ph.D. in 2004 from the University of Texas at Austin. He is an inventor of the Neuroevolution of Augmenting \nTopologies (NEAT) and HyperNEAT algorithms for evolving complex artificial neural networks. His main \nresearch contributions are in neuroevolution (i.e. evolving neural networks), generative and developmental \nsystems, coevolution, machine learning for video games, and interactive evolution. He has won best paper \nawards for his work on NEAT, NERO, NEAT Drummer, HyperNEAT, novelty search, and Galactic Arms Race. He \nis the chair of the IEEE Task Force on Computational Intelligence and Video Games, an associate editor \nof IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, and chaired the Generative and Developmental \nSystems track at GECCO from 2007 to 2009.
