Categories and Subject Descriptors D.m [Software]: Miscella\u00adneous \nGeneral Terms Design Keywords Creativity, photography Bio Benjamin C. Pierce is Professor of Computer \nand Information Sci\u00adence at the University of Pennsylvania. Before Penn, he served on the faculty at \nIndiana University and held research fellow\u00adships at Cambridge University, the University of Edinburgh, \nand INRIA-Roquencourt. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in 1991. \nAs a computer scientist,1 his interests center on programming languages, static type systems, computer \nsecurity and privacy, con\u00adcurrent and distributed programming, and synchronization tech\u00adnologies. His \nbooks include the widely used graduate text Types and Programming Languages. He is also the lead designer \nof the popular Unison .le synchronizer. As a photographer,2 his primary concerns are abstraction and \nthe human .gure sometimes in isolation, often in combina\u00adtion. His mentors include Arno Minkkinen, Sean \nKearnen, Becky Young, and Gabe Martinez.
