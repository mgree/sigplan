Professor Forrest received the Ph.D. \nin Computer and Communication Sciences from the University of Michigan. Before joining UNM she worked \nfor Teknowledge Inc. and was a Director's Fellow at the Center for Nonlinear Studies, Los Alamos National \nLaboratory. Professor Forrest is a member of the External Faculty at the Santa Fe Institute and Co-chair \nof its Science Board. She also served as SFI's Interim Vice President 1999-2000. Professor Forrest is \na member of the Adaptive Computation Group at UNM, where she studies adaptive systems, including genetic \nalgorithms, computational immunology, biological modeling, and computer security. She is also a member \nof the Program in Interdisciplinary Biological &#38; Biomedical Science (PIBBS) and the Center for Evolutionary \nand Theoretical Immunology (CETI).  \n\t\t\t", "proc_id": "1869459", "abstract": "<p>As programmers, we like to think of software as the product of our intelligent design, carefully crafted to meet well-specified goals. In reality, software evolves inadvertently through the actions of many individual programmers, often leading to unanticipated consequences. Large complex software systems are subject to constraints similar to those faced by evolving biological systems, and we have much to gain by viewing software through the lens of evolutionary biology. The talk will highlight recent research that applies the mechanisms of evolution quite directly to the problem of repairing software bugs.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Stephanie Forrest", "author_profile_id": "81100610083", "affiliation": "University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA", "person_id": "P2354194", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/1869459.1869539", "year": "2010", "article_id": "1869539", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "The case for evolvable software", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1869539"}
