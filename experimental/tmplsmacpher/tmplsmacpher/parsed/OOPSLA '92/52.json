These properties must bedesigned into the software product. This tutorial shows how to makedesign decisions so the product will do what its users want and sothe buzzwords actually show up in the product. The tutorial willwork through the steps of a design project, documenting user andproducer needs, modeling the thing objects, describing behaviorwith event response models, and, finally, developing anarchitecture for the product. Part of each step is evaluating thedesign against the magic words. The result will be a productstructure that is probably very different from conventionalsoftware architectures, but one that can be measured against thedesign criteria.</p><p>This tutorial teaches the explicit design of software. It usesnotations from several existing methods. You may use your ownnotations, if you wish.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Douglas Bennett", "author_profile_id": "81408600558", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P69596", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157762", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157762", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Object design of modularity, reuse and quality (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157762"}
