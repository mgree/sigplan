Keynote talks described: far-reaching multidimensional \ndevelopment methods the problems of semantic coupling between objects a highly iterative development \nproject using a symbolic language a pioneering development where high-level management was given a traditional \nview of development, while first-level management enjoyed the benefits of more loosely structured iteration \nthe use of formal specifications as a universal development tool facilitating compactness and analysis \n Discussion on architecture, tools and reuse, and management techniques followed. Key areas of consensus \nincluded the multidimensionality of architecture, the inadequacy of class models alone to encapsulate \nchange, the importance of tool support, and the need for local standards such as software backplanes. \n Introduction This year, the longstanding- The Bottom Line: Using Object-Oriented Development in the \nCommercial Environment and the new- Development Processes for Use of the Object Paradigm were combined \ninto a single workshop because of their anticipated significant overlap in coverage. The combination \nproved exciting and fruitful, with many new perspectives on management practices, suitable technologies, \nand development methods to support object-oriented product development. These notes present the highlights \nof the combined workshop. We first summarize position talks given at the workshop, and follow up with \nsummaries from working groups that met in the afternoon. We conclude with common threads of agreement, \nas well as areas of difference, which we hope to use as a basis for reconvening this workshop next year \nin Washington, D. C.  Workshop Keynote Talks We kicked off the workshop with five keynote talks designed \nto set the tone for the day and to provide context for discussion. The talks were drawn from the thirteen \nposition papers that were accepted for 5-10 October 1992 -lOl- the workshop, on the basis that these \nfive papers typified the work in their respective areas. Development Processes for Use of the Object \nParadigm, by Jim McGee, ObjecTime Ltd. This talk presented a development process featuring overlap in \nthe construction of executable models for requirements, high-level design, and detailed design, asinFigure1. \nExecution &#38; time Figure 1 Executable Models The development method is called Real-Time Object- Oriented \nModeling (ROOM), and it is supported by a tool set called ObjecTime. The talk motivated the need for \nmulti-dimensional abstraction, noting that it is not useful to think of a large system at the level of \nabstraction of a programmer. As a result it is best to try to break up levels of concern in terms of \nabstraction. The main levels of abstraction in ROOM iilE 1. A Master system layering. This layering is \nnot limited to being 2-dimensional like a protocol stack, but can have more complex interactions 2 A \nmodel of coarse-grain distribution (that models things within a layer boundary) 3. The detail level, \nthat familiar to programmers McGee s position paper states that the rapid cooperative construction of \nexecutable specification and high-level design models is a key factor in ensuring a proposed product \nwill meet customer needs, and make the resulting software development more predictable, reliable and \nless costly. A verification model is developed for each executable model, and models at all levels can \nbe executed and tested against their verification models using ObjecTime. The application is generated \nfrom the model by a code generator. Other aspects of the ROOM approach that help manage iterative development \ninclude: In ROOM, developers manage interfaces as objects in their own right. . It is becoming important \nto use domain-specific development models (for telecommunications, things are drifting toward objects \nand formal state machines). Do the hard parts first; it makes the easy parts easier. . Inheritance is \na first class architectural concern. A Modern Development Process: Experience Gained from TOPAZ Project, \nRod Arbaugh, ESL. Rod talked about Topaz, a fixed-cost development that took place over two years, involving \n20 to 35 developers, and producing about 300 KLOC. Traditional development uses information hiding and \nblack box abstraction to manage complexity; it is exemplified in the way hardware design is done. In \nsoftware, the virtual black boxes -complex graphics systems, Ada (a Registered Trademark of the Department \nof Defense) task management, and the operating system-interact intensely through their common underlying \nhardware, yielding a high aggregate complexity and unpredictable performance. Complexity and interaction \nof underlying mechanisms track each other closely. So in reality, abstraction and predictable behavior \nare technically opposing development objectives: There is a conflict between BlackBox and White Box understanding. \nThis conflict surfaces in the guise of reuse myths, ideal prototypes, and by backtracking, iteration \nand fractal design in the software development process. Grey Box Interfaces model the kind of behavior \nobserved when dealing with performance and synchronization problems in large systems. The growing web \nof objects unknowingly share common sets of limited resources, and the percent of abstraction that needs \nto be hidden goes up quickly with increasing complexity. This makes it difficult to manage classes and \nobjects as units of iteration. This talk elicited lively discussion. Russel Winder (University College \nLondon) noted that people will not use black boxes unless they have some idea of how they work internally-it \ns an issue of trust. Individuals working on isolated portions of an application yearn to know how the \nwhole things works to provide a context for their own work. Anticipating what he would address in his \ntalk later, Tsvi Bar-David (Monmouth College) called grey box interfaces model-based specifications. \nAs an example of how a given system may split the difference between detail and abstraction, he cited \nI- nodes in UNIX, something understood by a low- level programmer but not necessary for working at the \napplication level. Jim Coplien (AT&#38;T) noted that in resource-limited or real-time systems, increased \ncoupling may be used as an optimization. In fault-tolerant systems, high coupling is often necessary \nto maintain the integrity of data structures. Bob Rose (Centerline) echoed a widely held sentiment that \npeople, in general, don t trust libraries. They want to be able to peek inside and find out how they \nwork (say, during debugging). Warren Montgomery (AT&#38;T) likened manual pages to spec sheets, or data \nsheets used in hardware. The thing a data sheet does is allow you to specify all inputs and outputs. \nMany libraries have hidden side- effects not documented in their interfaces. An Iterative Process for \nObject-Oriented Development, Warren Montgomery, AT&#38;T. Traditional software product management is \nburdened by logistical difficulties, such as very long compile, link-editing and initialization phases \nwhich make it difficult to do things incrementally. This is complicated by interconnectedness, which \nmakes it difficult to understand where to make a change or what its impact will be. The rigor of waterfall \nmethods is commonly believed to compensate for these problems. But waterfall brings its own problems, \nincluding inflexibility in requirements once they are set, and the subsequent missed schedule and budget \ntargets that come from changing customer needs, requirements, and standards. He also noted that the cost \nof change under waterfall is usually proportional not to the size of the change, but the size of the \nsystem, making it difficult to do small things quickly and cheaply. And problems only get worse as a \nsystem ages. As an alternative, he posed a Tornado Process model for iterative development. It starts \nwith an initial definition of a need, followed by analysis, design, implementation and integration phases; \nthis cycle is repeated in tight loops. Short (approximately 2 week) development cycles allow rapid reaction \nto changes. The system under development remains stable (that is, changes do not disrupt system operation) \nas changes are continuously integrated. The process is managed to maintain this short cycle and ensure \nprogress toward delivery. Documentation, design, and implementation are developed concurrently and with \ncustomer feedback. Montgomery made the point that one needs a clean, well-partitioned architecture to \novercome system coupling and the logistics of large system development. (A major theme of the remainder \nof the day would be the relationship between architecture and process.) Their architecture is based on \nframeworks which reflect the subdomains for a given product, and which are used to organize functionally \nrelated objects. Frameworks are the loci of software ownership and control. While framework objects are \nimportant building blocks in the architectural structure, they alone cannot capture all dimensions of \ninterest in a complex system. A typical application object typically contains a small amount of code \nspecific to the application, supported by CLOS-style multiple inheritance mixins that communicate with \nobjects in the frameworks. Everything is done in one language (here, CLOS), rather than using special \nrequirements or design languages. Implementation is a refinement of a design specified in the language \nof implementation. A rich run-time environment, including real-time garbage collection, removes developers \nfrom mundane housekeeping chores. An overall theme of the approach is to reduce manual effort, automating \nas much as possible. The approach to logistic problems: Make everything work incrementally. This may \ninvolve the need to be able to update a running system. Analysis and design must be incremental. PrototvDe \nProduct IInterval c= 1 Iteration l-n Iterations (3) Developers 1 1 + Consulting Architecture Limited \nComplete and Reviewed Documenta- None User and tion Design Testing Stability Regression + Function Figure \n2: Difference Between a Prototype and a Product Montgomery took up the challenge of comparing a prototype \nto a product, at least with respect to his approach (Figure 2). In short, the differences are in scope \nand robustness rather than in approach. F rototyping, for them, leads to the first implementation of \na product rather than precursing a development effort per se. Rather than iterate analysis, then design, \nthen implementation, their approach is to iterate quickly from top to bottom to get running code quickly, \nand stable, non-operational code even more quickly. It may be instructive for the reader to compare \nand contrast Montgomery s approach with that of McGee. Development Processes for the Use of the Object \nParadigm, David Weller, CAE-Link, and Viktor Ohnjec, Rational Weller and Ohnjec described their effort, \na first-time application incorporating object-oriented (and other) techniques at CAR-Link, which builds \nlarge, distributed, real-time flight simulator control software. This talk quickly embraced the question \nof architecture, defining it as a consistent manner in which we build software. While there was a flurry \nof discussion concerning the details of the words, the important theme of the definition survived: Developers \nfrequently don t have a grasp of how their software is going to fit into a system. As an example: to \nsimulate malfunctions, testers need to violate the encapsulation of system objects to break the system. \nThey looked to object orientation as a framework to address these issues by having deliberate reuse team \nwho look for reuse opportunities. Systems of objects are gathered into partitions, which serve as the \nunits of distribution. The mapping of partitions to processors is transparent to the application programmer, \nbeing automated by reconfiguration software at load time. Architecture is, then, how to plug your application \nmodules into the system, or perhaps, what is the shape of the plugs into which software modules may be \ninserted? This raises the image of a software backplane, reminiscent of the model of Montgomery s talk, \nand a premonition of architectural considerations in the tools and reuse subgroup which was to follow. \nThe presenters offered some interesting insights into the iteration process. They maintain a hierarchy \nof iteration cycle times, with rapid iteration at the developer level, slower iteration at lower management \nlevels, and increasingly lower through upper management and customer-visible levels. The software is \nbuilt by little chunks at a time, Upper managers are comfortable because their high-level view of the \nprocess is little different than the waterfall perspective they are used to. Because lower level managers \ncan identify risks earlier, they feel better control over schedule and can better forecast delivery times \nto their superiors, whether they are on time or late. Low-level managers can generate documents as necessary \nto accommodate upper management s model of development. The granularity of development is three to four \ndevelopers. Capability views are generated every two to three months. Perhaps counterintuitively, they \nfound that the value of using an iterative process increases with progression along the life cycle. Rational \nwas brought on as a consulting firm, and provided on-site staff to assist with configuration management \nand version control, target compilation support, test scaffolding and test case management, and internal \ninterface publication and enforcement. Reinforcing what we had heard earlier in the day, they noted that \nthe best way to express architectural constraints is with the implementation language itself. Object-Oriented \nProgramming Should Be Driven by Formal Specification, Tsvi Bar- David, DeerWorks and Monmouth University \nThis lively and entertaining talk introduced us to the importance of considering formal methods by way \nof a case study on a simple but commonly-used class library. Tsvi believes the time has come to take \nformal methods seriously, that they can be scaled, and in fact that most historic hurdles to use of formal \nmethods can be overcome. Tsvi defined formal methods as a way of meaning what you say, saying what you \nmean, or as a way of talking about the behavior of a software entity in an unambiguous and typically \nformal fashion. We should use formal methods because of: Their freedom from ambiguity; Their brevity \n(smaller by a factor of five than a natural language document); Their potential for being universal. \n To both motivate the need for formal methods and to illustrate that formal methods could be applied, \nTsvi told a story about analysis of a List class in a widely used library. His students analyses of the \nspecification of List revealed internal inconsistencies, particularly with regard to the placement of \nList cursor on completion of an operation. Tsvi and his colleagues are evolving methodologies for semiautomatic \ngeneration of code from formal specifications.  Working Groups The morning s presentations, and associated \ndiscussions, evidenced interest in a broad diversity of topics related to the workshop theme. The group \nwent through an exercise to identify areas of maximum interest. Three subgroups were identified: Architecture, \nTools and Reuse, and Management. The question list in its entirety is preserved in Appendix A. Architecture \n(Moderator: Fred Wild, Cadre Technologies) The architecture subgroup took on questions raised in the \nmorning s discussion: What is being represented? Who owns or controls architecture? What do analysis \nand design influences bring to architecture? What are the types of architecture? How does change affect \narchitecture? When an object changes, how does that influence the rest of the architecture? What is \narchitecture, and what is being represented? Overall principles of operation or form; Structure of coherent \nroles or interactions at a chosen level of interaction and focus of concern; A framework with possible \nnested frameworks, recursively, but not necessarily a tree. Who owns the architecture? The importance \nof architectural ownership is amplified by Conway s law: the organizational structure and system software \nstructure reflect each other. Architectural ownership policies vary widely from company to company, culture \nto culture, and project to project. In some companies systems group owns some aspects, and other aspects \nare deferred. Marc Webster s position paper describes an architectural hierarchy within Xerox, where \nthe corporate CEO views himself as the corporate architect, and the issue of architecture is a central \ntheme at the highest levels of the company [ 11. Software architecture (e.g., for copier products) is \nheaded by a systems group with market-driven ties to architectural subteams within individual product \ndevelopments. What does this portend for change and iteration? The following points summarize our findings: \n1. Objects exist inside an environment that constrains them into an acceptable set of implementations; \n 2 Architectures are longer-lived than objects; 3. An architecture s malleability is inversely proportional \nto the maturity of the architecture: 4. Changes can be local, coordinated, or global. A key area of \nagreement in the discussion was that architectures have multiple tops, and many viable views. That means \nno single hierarchical partitioning is sufficient, but some network structure is necessary. Aspects of \nthis appear in McGee s development taxonomy, in Montgomery s use of mixins, and in other papers as well. \nWhat do analysis and &#38;sign influences bring to architecture? There was a strong sentiment that traditional \nanalysis and design as codified are starting to become obsolete. The differences between analysis, design, \nimplementation and verification are beginning to blur as markets and technology change. Iterative techniques \nare filing this niche nicely in many instances, and often displace the traditional methods. There was \ninsufficient time to develop a taxonomy of architectures. Such a taxonomy might be useful if different \nclasses of architecture suggest different development approaches. More thorough treatment of this topic \nis deferred to the next instantiation of this forum. Managing Object-Oriented Development and Iteration \n(Moderator: Ron Cracker, Motorola) The main questions investigated by this subgroup were: 1. How do we \nmanage object-oriented work products to fixed work products? 2 How to involve users in the effort to \nelicit their implied requirements? 3. How should object-oriented development efforts be managed? First, \nthe subgroup constructed a definitional model of prototyping as a basis for discussion on how to manage \nit. There is a distinction between horizontal and vertical prototyping: Horizontal-A broad shallow slice \nof the entire system, with primary focus on the customer and understanding their needs; Vertical-Selecting \none need and taking it all the way to completion. The goal of both types is to understand the problems \nand to validate the design. The grey area between analysis and design causes problems with respect to \nexpected work products. This adds to confusion about work product intervals, and to management discomfort \nManagers need periodic feedback, such as analysis and design snapshots as progress is made, to feel comfortable \n S-10 October 1992 lOS-that work is moving forward. Publication of such plans is important, although \nit is important to retain the perspective that the plan s main function is to serve as a reminder of \nthe activities of the planning process as much as its results. Focusing on reuse early resonates with \ncontemporary management expectations for the object paradigm, and reusing domain-specific components \nin particular should be a project goal. On the other hand, it is important that reuse be explicitly managed, \nparticularly with an eye to long-term project needs. Managing rapid iteration of broadly used components \nbrings special management challenges, a difficult issue for which consideration was deferred. Education \nis perhaps the most important undertaking to put appropriate management structure and policy into place. \nNot only managers, but users and the development team as well, must be educated about what the new products \nand their expected costs are to be. Up-front assessment of time, tool, and aaining costs, and presentation \nof such costs to management, is also important. An ongoing posture of learning and understanding is important \nif the team is to gracefully adapt to incremental development, in the sense of the learning organizations \nof Senge [21. User participation in the front end, prototyping stage (discovering requirements) is essential \nand has a long-term payoff,though the payoff is difficult to quantify except in hindsight. User expectations \nfor prototyping must be carefully tempered early on, so convincing prototypes aren t confused with convergence \non delivery of a robust product. Iteration is of course a better fit for some cultures than for others. \nIn stereotypical small, start-up shops comfortable with risk, it might be an easy sell. It closely managed, \nmetric-driven projects of significant scale, adopting radical techniques like iterative development is \noften indicative either of keenly astute managers, or of desperate ones. The subgroup also touched on \nthe question of how to incentivize reuse, pointing to IBM s royalty system of one workable approach. \nThey note it is important to incentivize reuse both from the writing and reading points of view: There \nshould be rewards involved in re-using code, as well as writing code that can be re-used. And the cost \nof reusable code should be neither too high nor too low [3]. Reuse and Tools (Moderator: Jeff Kohley, \nMotorola (Tools), Justin Graver, Motorola (Reuse)} This subgroup, too, took a stab at defining iteration: \nsharpening fidelity to user requirements performed iteratively. From that platform, the group agreed \non the need for tools supporting reuse of analysis, design, implementation, and test. However, these \nphases are to be understood as obsolete in their traditional sense, yielding to iterative approaches. \nObjecTime comprises many such tools; Ward Cunningham spoke of a related tool set in an OOPSLA 92 panel \nas well. The Architecture team offered some high-level reuse guidelines. First, reuse should be defined \nand overseen by domain experts, particularly for the domain-specific reusable software that should become \nthe focus of future reuse efforts. Second, homage must be paid to the Rules of Three [4]- examine three \nsystems in a domain before deciding what is worth reusing; count on three times the effort up-front to \nmake software reusable; don t expect pay-back until the third re-use; etc. There was also universal agreement \non the need for a tool backplane or common framework through which tools can interact and communicate. \nIt is important to have a class query database, semantic browsing capabilities, version management (maintaining \nsoftware history) and version control (propagation of changes into public views) in this backplane. Version \nmanagement tools should provide a high degree of developer control, and should support moving both forward \nand backward along the time line (e.g., through undo, redo, and skip commands). Such tools exist, though \nno single coherent tool set meets all these needs. To help deal with detail, tools should be able to \nchange levels of abstraction along views and levels. Testing tools, particularly for regression testing, \nare also important. Automatic generation of test cases from designs-a demonstrable approach-would be \nof great value. Generation of test suites from specifications, an emerging technique, should also be \nencouraged. Pulling it Together Consensus Points The workshop generated a surprising level of consensus. \nTo summarize: Architecture comprises, or should comprise, multiple tops or views. The number of important \nor insightful patterns that exist in major software projects go far beyond those of class structure or \nthose used in common design approaches. There may be overlap with the work in Peter Coad s workshop on \npatterns, something we will follow up on. . As a corollary to the above, classes alone do not encapsulate \nchange. Incremental development cannot rely on class interfaces for developer independence. Tool support \nis important for software discovery and reuse, an important aspect of building prototypes. Tools should \nfocus not only on code, but on analysis results, designs, and testing as well. Software backplanes are \ngood, both for application software and for the tool set supporting their development. Open Issues We \ndid not achieve consensus on the issue of whether iteration should use one language throughout development \n(CAE-Link, AT&#38;T) or whether different phases should use separate languages (ObjecTime). We also deferred \ndiscussion on how to iteratively build widely (re-)used libraries and components, and on how to categorize \nprojects and architectures according to their suitability for iterative methods. These should provide \ngood starting points for next year s session.
