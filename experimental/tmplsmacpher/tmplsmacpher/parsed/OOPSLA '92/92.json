It was originally developed by KentBeck and Ward Cunningham, but has been reimplemented many timessince then. Most of these implementations were proprietary. Ourdesign extends the original one by making constraints morecomposable and by adding metafigures, but the system is instantlyrecognizable by anyone familiar with one of the earlierimplementations.</p><p>We wrote a version of HotDraw for ObjectWorks\\Smalltalk Release4.0 that we are distributing. We will describe and demonstrate thebasic framework and several applications built from it, such as avisual programming language, a tool for inspecting Smalltalkobjects by drawing pictures of them, an environment for learningSmalltalk by issuing commands and writing scripts for visibleobjects, and a PERT chart editor. These applications illustrateseveral advanced Smalltalk techniques, such as light-weightclasses, compiling code on the fly, and dynamically redirectingmessages by overriding doesNotUnderstand:. Time permitting, wellexplore the implementation of HotDraw and how it uses thesetechniques.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Ralph Johnson", "author_profile_id": "81100453209", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP14159358", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157803", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157803", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "HotDraw (abstract): a structured drawing editor framework for Smalltalk", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157803"}
