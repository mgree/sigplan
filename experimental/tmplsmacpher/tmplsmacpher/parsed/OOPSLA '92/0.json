Wilkes IBM \nCorporation Presenting the Addendum Continuing a tradition begun at the second OOPSLA Conference in \nOrlando, we present this year s edition of the Addendum to the Proceedings for the 1992 Conference. This \nvehicle is intended to complement the published Proceedings of the Conference-to present work that developed \nonly during or subsequent to the conference. It serves as a record of various interchanges which give \nsuch breadth to our conference . . . and to give those who were unable to attend a flavor of the interchanges \n(and energy) that constitute the meeting in Vancouver. The 1992 Conference The conference in Vancouver \nset some high water marks that future conferences may have difficulty surpassing-the largest attendance \n(nearly 3000), substantial demonstration programs, a great set of Poster submissions, and our usual broad \nand deep Tutorial program. In another aspect Vancouver is going to be hard to forget. The social program \nassociated with the conference reached a standard that amazed almost everyone attending. In particular, \nthe Welcoming Reception, taking over the entire public space of the Pan Pacific Hotel, and putting on \ndisplay an awesome display of food and refreshments that will be remembered for some time. The creators \nof this deserve some kind of lifetime achievement award.  Addendum A 92 to the Proceedings Addendum \n92- Introduction The Program In addition to the usual offerings: Keynote Talks, Panel Reports, Workshop \nReports, Experience Reports and Poster Papers, this year s Addendum also includes talks, papers and panels \nfrom the Educators Symposium, as well as short summaries of all the Tutorials and Demonstrations. Technical \nProgram A broad range of topics were addressed in the technical program. These are reported, for the \nmost part, in the Conference Proceedings. However, a number of items are not reported there, and we take \nit upon ourselves each year to include appropriate coverage of such events. Grady Booth, one of the invited \nspeakers for this conference, is represented here by his submission The End of Objects and the Last Programmer. \nThe reports known as the Experience Reports (as distinquished from the Experience Papers, which were \npresented in the Proceedings), are reported on here.  Panels The Panel sessions were the most heavily \nattended sessions in the technical program. We present here the reports of various of these lively sessions. \n S-10 October 1992 -1 -Addendum to the Proceedings  Workshops Of course, to many, the r&#38;on d etre \nof a conference such as ours is the opportunity to meet and communicate with others working in the field, \nto share mutually stimulated interests. This happens throughout the conference, but is particularly distilled \nin the various Workshops. Some of these have become standing Workshops, meeting annually to move the \nknowledge of a particular domain forward another notch. Some have been almost mini-conferences in themselves. \nWe doggedly attempt to convince Workshop organizers to report on there communications in the Addendum. \nMany reports are presented here. Poster Submissions Returning to the conference program this year are \nPoster Submissions. These are unrefereed submissions, of modest length, which are typically presented \nto attendees via pin-up, bulletin-board presentations available for browsing during the conference. In \naddition, this year these Poster Submissions were presented at the banquet. Furthermore, due to the diligence \nof Mark Whiting, we are able to present here in the Addendum a brief sketch of each (and all) of the \nPoster Submissions. These precis are not the full submissions available at the conference, but are intended \nto reflect the central ideas within the constraints which we gave to the submittors. The Educators Symposium \nA new dimension to our conference was added this year in the form of a complete program on the problems \nof education for object oriented users. This event drew upon hundreds of participants, and took an entire \nday of the conference for their deliberations. We present here most of the material which appeared in \nthe Symposium. The Addendum to the Addendum In what is hoped will be a once only event, we are presenting \nhere a submission which should have appeared in the 1991 Addendum. Through the editors fault, this was \nnot previously published. Mamdouh implored us to make restitution. Hopefully we have.  Comments Titles \nfor various submissions presented here appear to be aiming for new length records. When the editors must \nbreak a title into three lines to fit it into the table of contents, one can assume that the future may \nhold page limitations for titles as much as for the contents of the submissions. The neologistic streak \nthat infects software people (particularly object oriented software people) is alive and well. One can \nfind herein, mind twisters such as: analysis paralysis, oopaholic, and even object orientedly. The \nScene A single physical body was simply not sufficient for taking in all the events of interest to any \none person at OOPSLA 92. Even as the editors kept up what seemed to us to be very full schedules and \na steady pace while attending the conference, we were unable to attend everything we were interested \nin. This is likely to have been true for many of you who attended in Vancouver as well. OOPSLA is a very \nunique conference. By making a concerted effort to capture in this Addendum the essence of those events \nthat only unfold at the conference, we hope you will feel like you have a second chance at the things \nyou missed. Thanks to all who submitted material for the Addendum-no matter how hard we had to twist \nyour arm to get things in on time! As you can see from the volume of this issue, submission participation \nwas strong this year. Read and enjoy- Jerry &#38; Mark  Contact information: Jerry L. Archibald IBM \nCorporation T. J.
