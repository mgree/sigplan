Executable programs are automatically generated by a CASEtool (the Demeter System/C++) from the graphical high-leveldescriptions. Unlike other specification languages, the DemeterMethod allows you to keep the binding of methods to classesflexible under changing class structures. The higher level ofabstraction leads to shorter and more reusable programs than byprogramming directly in one of todays object-oriented languagessuch as C++, Smalltalk, Eiffel or CLOS.</p><p>Because the Demeter Method is regularly taught at NU both at thegraduate and undergraduate level with the 10 week quarter system,it has become, by nnecessity, very easy to learn.</p><p>This tutorial is for professionals who want to learn powerful,formally defined high-level concepts that describe the programmingtask in terms of data-model-based graphs and their subgraphs.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Lieberherr", "author_profile_id": "81452617626", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP39075223", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157771", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157771", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Object-oriented software development with the Demeter Method (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157771"}
