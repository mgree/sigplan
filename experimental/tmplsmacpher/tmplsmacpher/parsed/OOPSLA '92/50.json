It examines several of the most well-known methods,including Booth, Coad/Yourdon, Odell/Martin, Rumbaugh, andSchlaer/Mellor, but its analysis techniques can be applied to anymethod.</p><p>In general, each method is made up of several techniques (e.g.ER modeling, state transition diagrams) each of which emphasizes aparticular aspect of the system. These techniques can be classifiedas being for structural (data), behavioral architectural modeling.The tutorial shows the techniques each method uses and howdifferent methods use different dialects of the same I techniques,varying the notation and introducing new concepts. It uses examplesto show how the same system is expressed in different ways by thevarious methods. The tutorial also compares the design approachadvocated by each method.</p><p>This tutorial will help you decide which method will work bestfor you. In addition, you will learn how ideas from differentmethods can be combined to better suit the system underanalysis.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Martin Fowler", "author_profile_id": "81100062314", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP39071898", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157763", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157763", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "A comparison of object-oriented analysis and design methods (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157763"}
