It is usedby (almost) all France-based banks, and thousands of customers.</p><p>RONDO is an 00 file server, supporting these protocols. It wasdeveloped in BORLAND C++, with TURBO VISION graphics library.Without the included files, the overall code lines, as reported bythe project manager, are 22,000. The server works fine on a 386based PC, DOS 5.0. RONDOs capabilities are:<br></p><ul><li>support up to four file transfers on public switchedcommunication lines, and four file transfers on X25 virtualcircuits, simultaneously,</li><li>on-line verification of incoming files for format correctness,and</li><li>on-line surveillance and administration.</li></ul><p>The demonstrations purposes are:<br></p><ul><li>present a real-time application of the 00 technology, includinginterrupt control and encapsulation of an OEM X25 driver (not00);</li><li>present a brand new user comfort for DOS communicationapplications;</li><li>real time information about incoming transfers;</li><li>optional operator zoom on different monitors: status,statistics, log, traffic, trace, file verification;</li><li>configuration control;</li><li>client diagnosis and support;</li><li>present the internal objects grouped in 4 domains:communication, administration, user interface, and systemextension.</li></ul><br><br> <p>Through graphic objects, this technology brings a spectacularnew comfort to DOS users with less overhead than in graphicalenvironments. For developers it provides reusable objects andsimple building logic.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Ion Cartiant", "author_profile_id": "81392590899", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P116674", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157797", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157797", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Object-oriented communication server for banking applications (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157797"}
