Constraints have been used in a variety oflanguages and systems, particularly in user interface tool kits, inplanning and scheduling, and in simulation. They provide anintuitive declarative style of programming that integrates wellwith object-oriented systems.</p><p>This tutorial teaches what constraints are, how to use them inapplications such as user interfaces, how to implement them(including how to implement constraint hierarchies), and how toembed them in object-oriented and logic programming languages. Youdont have to know anything about constraints, but it would behelpful to have a strong background in programming languages.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Bjorn Freeman-Benson", "author_profile_id": "81100123282", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P30954", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Alan Borning", "author_profile_id": "81100164129", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP15024639", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157786", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157786", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Constraint-based languages and systems (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157786"}
