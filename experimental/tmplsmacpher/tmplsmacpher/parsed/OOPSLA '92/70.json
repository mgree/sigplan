Thetutorial describes analysis and design techniques for dataabstraction, inheritance, delegation, persistence, atomicity,concurrency, synchronization, and coordinated behavior in adistributed object-oriented framework. Special attention will bepaid to the uniform integration of these concepts with theobject-oriented paradigm. Discussions will be accompanied byexamples that arose from constructing such systems.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Mehmet Aksit", "author_profile_id": "81100296736", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP39068992", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157780", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157780", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "The analysis and design of distributed systems (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157780"}
