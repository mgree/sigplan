Ambler, University of Kansas<br>Margaret M. Burnett, Michigan Technical University</p><p>Visual programming language research has evolved greatly sinceits early days. At first, attempts at visual programming mostlytook the form of flowchart-like diagrams. But in recent years, awide number of innovative approaches have been incorporated intovisual languages, including object-oriented programming, form-basedprogramming, programming by demonstration, and dataflowprogramming. Unfortunately, while many of these systems representimportant ideas, only a few have been successful as complete visualprogramming languages. This tutorial explains why this is true, anddescribes ways in which the problem can be addressed.</p><p>This tutorial explores the issues behind the successes andfailures of earlier approaches from a design perspective. Itidentifies characteristics of successful visual programminglanguages, and explains how to design an object-oriented languagethat maintains those characteristics. It shows solutions to anumber of problems by looking at existing visual programminglanguages, including Prograph.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Allen L.
