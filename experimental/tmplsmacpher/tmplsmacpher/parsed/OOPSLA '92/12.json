Mellor, Project Technology \nPankaj Garg, HP-Lab, co-organizer of the panel  Aim of the panel Improving development processes is \na key issue for the software community in general. The literature gives us some guidance with respect \nto major activities of the development process. The waterfall, spiral and fountain model all agree upon \ndistinctions such as: requirements capture, analysis, design, implementation, testing, maintenance. They \nalso agree in that they do not provide a finer granularity of the inside activities of analysis and design. \nWe postulate that this omission is a key inhibitor to a more widespread acceptance of the 00 paradigm \nby project managers. They do not know how to plan a non-trivial 00 software development project. The \npurpose of this panel was to take the first steps towards developing such process models. More specifically \nthe panelists have been asked to address the following questions (among others): . Can you envision \na generic OOA/ OOD development process? If so what are the major steps and deliverables of these steps. \nIf not, why not? If a software development organization had to choose between either doing a paradigm \nshift to 00, or improving its rating on the SE1 maturity scale what would you recommend? What are the \nrelationships between the two? Qualify, if necessary, the answer with respect to an extant maturity level. \n It turned out that these, and the other questions, were quite hard for the panellists. Hence, we envision \na follow on panel in the future where these topics will be raised again. In addition to this panel, I \norganized in 1992, workshops on 00 process: one at ECOOP and one also at OOPSLA. All the events had in \ncommon that the presenterslpanelists had hardly anything to say about process. The most tangible contributions \nwere modest extensions of the standard macro process: requirements capture, analysis, design, implementation, \ntest, maintenance, enhanced, of course, by the recommendation to iterate. 5-10 October 1992 -61-Addendum \nto the Proceedings Hence, although the panel had lively exchanges, I refrain from giving the details \nbecause I do not feel that the state of the art was advanced. Instead I would like to point the reader \nto a report that proposes some details on the 00 analysis and design process: Dennis de Champeaux, Towards \nan 00 SW Development Process, HP-Labs Tech Report HPL-92-149, November 1992.
