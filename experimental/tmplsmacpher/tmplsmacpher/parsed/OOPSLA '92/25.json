Murphy Shaun Smith MPR Teltech Ltd. Introduction Command \nand control information systems (CCIS) must support the timely display of both raw and manipulated data \nfor a variety of users. The information which must be displayed by a CCIS ranges from the geographical \npositions of friendly forces to projections of enemy movement. In the past, the display of this information \nhas been limited to simple textual and graphical presentations. Recent improvements in computer hardware \nand communication bandwidth, however, now permit the use of multiple presentation forms including images, \nsound, video and animation to succinctly convey the interrelated information found in a CCIS. This poster \ndescribes the results of applying object- oriented and hypermedia technologies to the development of \na framework capable of supporting the construction of multiple CCIS applications. Existing media forms \nsuch as the Interviews C++ graphical library lLVC881 have been wrapped to facilitate the development \nof the framework. The framework builds upon the object-oriented approaches to hypermedia employed in \nthe Intermedia System [YHMD891 and described in [Gibgl].  An Object-Oriented Hypermedia Framework The \nframework provides a set of abstract classes to organize multiple media forms, to permit the specification \nof navigational links between the media forms, and to specify a common protocol with an application for \npresentation and manipulation of media forms. In addition to the abstract framework classes, a set of \nconcrete library classes are defined to provide an example of the usage of the framework. These concrete \nclasses provide interfaces to the commercial hyperCMedial library to support media forms like images \nand video, and to the InterViews library to support media forms like structured graphics. To date, 21 \nclasses have been described in an object- oriented analysis model of the framework using an extended \nversion of the Coad and Yourdon technique ([CY91], [Mur91]).

SlO October 1992 -135-Addendum to the Proceedings \nidentified Class/Objects are included in the analysis model. An object-oriented design has been produced \nby applying Responsibility-Driven Design [wBWW90] to the object-oriented analysis model. The design is \nrepresented using Booth class and object diagrams lBoo91]. A prototype implementation of the framework \nhas been developed in C++. Development of the framework is proceeding using an iterative software process \nmodel and is currently in the second of three planned iterations. Figure 1 illustrates a portion of the \ninheritance hierarchy from the hypermedia framework along with an outline of the depicted class responsibilities. \nFuture releases of the framework will integrate additional libraries such as the Terraview product to \nsupport the presentation and manipulation of maps.  Applying the Framework The first prototype application \ndeveloped within the framework is a dynamic server that supports the display of hypermedia objects created \nthrough a scripting language. It permits interaction with a set of hypermedia objects that could potentially \nbe exchanged within a distributed environment. In the context of a CCIS environment, the set of hypermedia \nobjects described in the script would be defined by an analyst at a command post, and the dynamic server \napplication would be used by the command authority to review the analyst s projections prior to taking \naction. Conclusion and Future Work Object-oriented technology is being employed to specify and develop \na framework for constructing hypermedia applications. The wrapping of existing software is an important \ncomponent of the approach being taken in the framework development as it supports substantial software \nreuse and highlights the need for hypermedia systems to act as integrators of information stored in existing \nformats. In the future, we hope to extend the services of the framework by considering synchronization \nissues that arise when displaying hypermedia objects, as well as automatic translation mechanisms that \nwould permit the conversion between subclasses of an abstract class. 1 ActiveObject 1 A I HypermediaObject \n[Image1 p&#38;q   (Canvas1 ActiveObject -controls the activity of an object (i.e., starting and stopping) \n Hypermedia Object -provides an abstract interface to multiple forms of media Audible -generalized media \nobjects that affect the sense of hearing upon presentation Spatial -generalized media objects that affect \nthe visual sense upon presentation Link -supports navigation across a connection between two Hypermediaobjects \nimage -displays static, high-resolution pictures Canvas -provides a 2-D drawing space for displaying \nor manipulating 2-D structured graphics Marker -provides an end-point for accessing one or more Links. \nFigure 1: A Portion of the Framework Hierarchy  2 Terraview is a registered trademark of Terralogics, \nInc.
