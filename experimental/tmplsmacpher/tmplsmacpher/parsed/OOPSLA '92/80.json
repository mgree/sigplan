The object-orientedapproach to spatial object modelling results in much moreunderstandable designs than non-object-oriented approaches.</p><p>This tutorial describes the design of several key components ofa system for dealing with spatial information which are: analyticalgeometry closed with respect to union, intersection and complementoperations; hierarchically structured objects for maintainingtopological information; object identity and problems arising fromchange of spatial objects in the database and user interface,transactions and copies of objects; dependencies of spatial objectsand their copies in the MVC user-interface architecture.</p><p>You should have experience in building user-interfaces andshould have some background in analytical geometry. Examples areshown in Smalltalk, so a basic knowledge of Smalltalk would behelpful.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Jan Krc-Jediny", "author_profile_id": "81392595879", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P134173", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Augustin Mrazik", "author_profile_id": "81392602640", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P23020", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157791", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157791", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Object-oriented geometry and graphics (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157791"}
