Each methodemploys its own set of models, notations, and processes, so it canbe difficult to combine them. This tutorial shows how to design amethod by providing a framework for understanding and evaluatingcurrent methods, applying it to three recent methods (OMT (Rumbaughet al), Responsibility Driven Design/CRC cards, Booth 91 Method),and combining them to produce a new method, FUSION, that builds ontheir best aspects.</p><p>The tutorial introduces a set of criteria for evaluating methodsfrom the viewpoint of the object-oriented concepts they support,the kinds of models and notations they employ and the process stepsthat they recommend. The criteria provides a way to understand theunderlying similarities and differences between methods.</p><p>The criteria were developed as part of a program to assess whatkind of method should be made available to HP engineers, which ledto the development of the FUSION method. The tutorial ends with abrief account of the usefulness of FUSION in practice.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Derek Coleman", "author_profile_id": "81100290523", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP31075109", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "Paul Jeremaes", "author_profile_id": "81100645386", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P221582", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157764", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157764", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Integrating analysis and design methods (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157764"}
