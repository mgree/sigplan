Dodani, University of Iowa</p><p>There are many techniques for specifying software. However, theyare not usually presented in a way that is directly applicable toobject-oriented software. This tutorial surveys both operationaland descriptive specification techniques, shows how to use them inseveral popular object-oriented software engineering methods, andprovides case studies of developing useful, formal specificationmechanisms that are appropriate for object-oriented softwareengineering.</p><p>The tutorial first describes criteria for choosing specificationmechanisms from both a theoretical (syntax and semantics,specifying properties, reasoning about properties, verification)and practical (ease of use, modularity, applicability, supportingtools) perspective. These criteria are then used to survey severalpopular operational (data flow diagrams, finite state machines, andpetri nets) and descriptive (entity-relationship models, logic, andalgebraic specifications) specification mechanisms. Finally itshows how to extend two of these techniques (algebraicspecifications and finite state machines) so that they are suitablefor object-oriented software engineering.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Mahesh H.
