OOCP decomposes a large program into a collection ofsmall modules that run and interact concurrently and are capable ofexploiting parallel hardware. The tutorial describes various levelsof integration between object-oriented programming and concurrency,leading to the notion of an active object, which unifies object andactivity, message passing and synchronization.</p><p>The tutorial introduces Concurrent Smalltalk to describeconcepts, constructs, and methodology. Examples include programmingwith continuations, divide and conquer, and pipelining. It alsoshows how to implement active objects, and uses Actalk as anexample. Finally, it compares various OOP models and languages,with a special focus on the Actor computation model.</p><p>Although the tutorial uses Smalltalk for examples, you dont needto know Smalltalk to understand it; a quick introduction toSmalltalk syntax is included. It assumes that you understandobject-oriented programming well, but little more about concurrencythan intuitive concepts of processes and synchronization.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Jean-Pierre Briot", "author_profile_id": "81100022758", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP39074157", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157765", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157765", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Object-oriented concurrent programming (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157765"}
