In the Cognitive Browser, other \nrelationships between objects and perhaps between entities which are outside the system are represented. \nOne such piece of information might be the history of a source control system. CVS is stand for Concurrent \nVersions System : CVS is a front end to the RCS, a Revision Control System in UNIX. CVS extends the notion \nof revision control from a collection of files in a single directory to a hierarchical collection of \ndirectories consisting of revision controlled files. Similarly, CogBrow will be able to trace the history \nof the (multi-programmer) development of a system. Hence the programmers viewpoint, which may change \nfrom day to day, task to task, will add a set of new structures onto the type hierarchy that is being \ndeveloped. Such a set of views can be expressed in terms of hypergraphs, both inside and outside the \nobject system itself. The Cognitive Browser employs a hypergraph as a representation of tasks (or tracks) \ninside the programmer s views of the object system. In the Graphical Knowledge Interface (GKI), applied \nto the field of architectural planning and analysis, the data on a hypergraph is totally objective. An \noverlap is purposely maintained in the development of the COSIDE systems, sharing C++ Class Libraries. \n 3. Graphical Knowledge Interfaces The Unit for Architectural Studies at the Bartlett School of Architecture \nat University College, London has been studying various graphical models of buildings and towns, evaluating \nvarious metrics on the graphs and trying to relate them to the analysis of buildings and urban design: \ncollectively called Space Syntax. An example is a complex urban form represented as a series of interrelated \nspaces, in terms of their lines of sights : this is termed the axial map. Here line elements, form the \nnodes of a graph, with the arcs of the graph representing the intersections of the lines of sight in \nthe real space. It is possible to draw a depth graph from one point in the axial map of the town, showing \nthe different relationship that each point has to the whole space. Consider the view of space or lines \nof sight from two different points. Differences can be quantified in terms of the degree of depth from \none point or shallowness from another point, averaged out over the whole graph to give integration for \neach point in the system. An Integration Map would show, for example, those spaces which were more or \nless integrated than others in a town plan. Note that the collection of depth graphs on the axial map \nform a hypergraph. 4. The Future Much of the initial design has been completed, and test programs have \nbeen installed for both CogBrow and the GKI projects. Hypergraphs are seen as the most applicable structures, \nboth in the CogBrow and GKI areas, allowing both the system designer and the user the opportunity to \nadd their own views. Both hypergraphical and graphical models are used in many areas, particularly surveying: \nsee for example [2] where hypergraphs are employed to generated data sets from survey data. The GKI work \nwill expand, using C++ Class Libraries developed at University College, London, to allow the on data \nsets associated with small towns. Later, very large database (VLDB) technologies will be needed to handle \nhuge cities, such Milan and London, to examine whether Space Syntax relates to the real world in global \nterms. Similarly, navigation (and reuse) of large object libraries, such as the Interviews [3] and NIHCL \nclass libraries will be supported in the Cognitive Browser, drawing (perhaps) on the analogies of navigation \nand perception of urban areas.
