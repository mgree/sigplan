Performers are the maininteraction units. They are visible and mouse or message activated;sample types include DisplayPerformers, Turtles, Graphs, andGauges. Performers are grouped on Stages; stages maintain localname spaces so that Performers can be named and intercommunicateusing their local names. While Performers are members of a class,they may also be specialised through the addition ofinstance-specific behaviour and structure; this may also beinherited from other performers.</p><p>Just as inheritance models is-kind-of relationships, performerscollected on a stage visibly and logically model is-part-ofrelationships, in a more flexible way than instance variables. Anapplication is usually just a specialised stage and its specialisedperformers. The performer-stage paradigm gives rise to models thatare at once well factored across their participating performers andyet are fully encapsulated within a stage. Audition is a threadedinterpreted language implemented in itself. At present we are usingAudition to investigate planning aids and simulations forindustrial situations.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Andrew Drinnan", "author_profile_id": "81100323662", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P17866", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "David Morton", "author_profile_id": "81332517080", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP48026361", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157800", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157800", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Audition (abstract): a tool for visual interactive modeling", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157800"}
