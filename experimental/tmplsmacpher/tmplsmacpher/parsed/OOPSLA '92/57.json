The tutorial is designed for those who want tounderstand the practical importance of the unique features of CLOSand also those who would like to learn how to use or buildobject-oriented simulation systems.</p><p>The tutorial emphasizes the underlying model of object-orientedprogramming in CLOS and distinguishes it from other models. It alsodescribes the requirements of a simulation system and the design ofDEVS-CLOS, a publicly available simulation system. DEVS-CLOS is anextension to CLOS that supports modeling and simulation. Itsupports visualization, supports hierarchical design ofsimulations, allows first-order logic in models, and supportsadaptive system simulation. The tutorial shows how a system likeDEVS-CLOS can be used to solve typical simulation problems, and howCLOS concepts like multimethods, multiple inheritance, pre- andpost-methods and dispatching algorithms were used in the design ofDEVS-CLOS.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Suleyman Sevinc", "author_profile_id": "81100439955", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP31093779", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157767", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157767", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Simulation with DEVS-CLOS (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157767"}
