It presents most of the current commercialOODBMS and several advanced prototypes with particular attention todistinguishing them in their data models, application interfacesand system architectures. It will also contrast the OODBMS approachwith extended relational systems. A goal of the tutorial is to giveparticipants an appreciation for the consequences of design choicesmade in the different systems. It concludes with a critique ofcurrent market offerings, and suggests there are significantregions of the design space to explore, and needs of advancedapplications that are still largely unmet by any databaseproduct.</p><p>This tutorial is designed both for those considering investingin OODBs and those who just want to understand the technology. Itassumes knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts, and somefamiliarity with conventional database systems, particularlyrelational databases.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "David Maier", "author_profile_id": "81414612904", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP40036020", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157770", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157770", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Introduction to object-oriented database management systems (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157770"}
