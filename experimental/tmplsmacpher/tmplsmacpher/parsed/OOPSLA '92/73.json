This tutorial provides that, and more. Itdescribes features of object-oriented languages that are difficultto implement efficiently, and how this has affected languagedesigns. It describes state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-arttechniques for implementing languages like C++ and Smalltalk.</p><p>Language features include dynamic binding and genericoperations, inheritance, user-defined control structures, statictype systems, multiple inheritance and virtual base classes, andmixing object-oriented and non-object-oriented programming.</p><p>The tutorial also addresses questions like: What are thetrade-offs in using the various implementation techniques? Whatproblems remain that block more efficient object-oriented languageimplementations? What might be promising areas for futureresearch?</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Craig Chambers", "author_profile_id": "81100528252", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP39047060", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "David Ungar", "author_profile_id": "81100365263", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "P64183", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}], "doi_number": "10.1145/157709.157785", "year": "1992", "article_id": "157785", "conference": "OOPSLA", "title": "Efficient implementation of object-oriented programming languages (abstract)", "url": "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=157785"}
