Our prototype, 1db, debugs C programs compiled for the MIPS R3000, Motorola 68020, SPARC, and VAX architectures. It can use a network to connect to faulty processes and can do cross-architecture debugging. 1db's total code size is about 16,000 lines, but it needs only 250&#8211;550 lines of machine-dependent code for each target.</p><p>1db owes its retargetability to three techniques: getting help from the compiler, using a machine-independent embedded interpreter, and choosing abstractions that minimize and isolate machine-dependent code. 1db reuses existing compiler function by having the compiler emit PostScript code that 1db later interprets; PostScript works well in this unusual context.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "Norman Ramsey", "author_profile_id": "81100300481", "affiliation": "", "person_id": "PP14110628", "email_address": "", "orcid_id": ""}, {"name": "David R.
