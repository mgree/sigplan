As technology, standards and \nideas evolve: so do the artifacts available for reuse. Our understanding of the non-technical issues \nassociated with reuse also progresses. This panel will look at reuse from 5 different perspectives. We \nwill look at the reuse of design patterns and of services in a service-based, distributed architecture \nas examples of artifacts relatively new to the corporate world. We will also focus on the psychological \nfactors affecting the success of reuse programs along with organizational modifications and measurement \ntechniques that will help make reuse work. Lastly, we will take a look at how certain kinds of reuse \ncan affect the success of a project at the user level, and what this might imply for measuring the effectiveness \nof our reuse programs. The audience will leave with some concrete ideas about how to implement and measure \nreuse program as well as new thoughts on what artifacts may be reused. Format: Each panelist will have \nten minutes to discuss their facet of reuse, followed by a 45 minute question and answer period. The \nuniqueness of this panel will be the clear distinction between each of the topics being presented and \nhow they all relate together to address one of the issues germane to the acceptance of object technology \nin the corporate world. Charles Berman Reuse of Design Patterns As we deliver systems in multiple technologies, \nour intellectual property lives more in the techniques, designs and business processes we represent rather \nthan in the code we write. The use of patterns in our organization operates on several levels: programmers \nuse language idioms in code construction; designers use object-oriented design patterns to construct \nsoftware frameworks, and systems analysts create business architectural patterns to describe the businesses \nwe support. This talk will cover experiences in the incorporation of patterns into the analysis and \ndesign practices of the organization, including a discussion of the players in the process, how they \ninteract, and how patterns are used to design, build and document systems. Charles Berman is Vice President \nof Application Architecture at Fidelity Investments Administrative and Investment Management Systems \nTechnology Division where he is responsible for CORBA and World Wide Web based systems for portfolio \nresearch and management. Charles has led the development of distributed object-oriented applications \nin the fields of Financial Services and Network Management since 1986. Sanjiv Gossain Reuse of Services \nIn designing object-oriented applications, objects are a powerful means of identifying and leveraging \nreusable, shared services that cross application boundaries. Using the principles of service-based architectures, \nwhereby applications are composed of local business logic accessing reusable enterprise services, it \nis possible to build open applications in shorter timeframes. Such applications usually provide easier \naccess to information and data sources that would previously have been locked within closed applications. \nA service object provides a set of coherent functions that are collectively grouped into a reusable shared \nservice available to a number of applications. Examples include: . ImageService, for storing and retrieving \ngraphical images . PricingService, for calculating the price of a set of complex financial instruments \n. ObjectStorageService, providing a service for storing and retrieving objects in some repository . \nMarketDataService, for providing simple access to real time market data  101 The access to these reusable \nservices is provided in a logical and controlled manner such that the requesters of that service are \noblivious to where that service is being provided from, or how that service is being provided. A service \nobject provides, manages, and tracks a service to requesters, based upon a contract of services, The \nuse of service objects as part of a service- based architecture is a very powerful means of organizing \na system such that essential aspects may be reused in later systems. They may also act as a means of \nlocalization and encapsulation for business (sub)processes that are often updated and may otherwise be \nspread throughout other objects in the system Sanjiv Gossain is Director of Technology (Europe) for Cambridge \nTechnology Partners, a professional services organization specializing indelivering high-payback business \nsolutions in unprecedented timeframes. He is a member of the ACM, IEEE, BCS, and is a Chartered Engineer. \n Brian Henderson-Sellers Measuring Reuse Managing any software development project requires adequate \nmeasurements to be taken and used as feedback to construct better strategies and techniques for future \nprojects ---no more so than in the development of a corporate-wide reuse policy. As expertise in managing \nobject-oriented (00) projects grows, such a body of 00 metrics knowledge will become increasingly usable \nacross the industry. There is no doubt that there is currently an intense interest in and demand for \ngood 00 metrics for reuse. There are two major problems with reuse metrics. Firstly, there is the technical \nderivation and testing of reuse measures. Secondly, there is the impact on the socio-cultural behavior \nof the industry and the team members of introducing any measurement program. Measurement of any kind \nis not just observing. It can alter human behavior. Consequently, one lesson from reuse metrics is that \nits focus is not just technical or engineering issues but also borders on an understanding of social \nscience and organizational behavior/management strategies. Brian Henderson-Sellers is Director ofthe \nCenter for Object Technology Applications and Research and Professor ofInformation Systems in the School \nof Computing Sciences at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS). He is author of three books on object \ntechnology (plus three more in press/preparation), well-known for his work in 00 methodologies (MOSES, \nCOMMA and OPEN) and in 00 metrics. Brian is also Regional Editor ofobject-Oriented Systems, a member \nof the editorial board qf Object Magazine, Convener of the Object- Oriented Special interest Group of \nthe Australian Computer Society (NSW Branch) and Chairman of the Computerworld Object Developers Awards \ncommittee,for Object World 94 and 95 Laura Hill The Psychology of Reuse As technologists, we all want \nto spend as much time as possible concentrating on the technical excellence of the products in our reuse \nlibrary; however the biggest factors preventing reuse success are psychological, rather than technical, \nin nature. Words like trust , control and credit are among those not quite said out loud. This talk will \nconsider the objectives and concerns of a reuse program from the perspectives of the main actors involved: \nthe component crafters, application developers, project managers, relationship managers and end users. \nFrom these personalized viewpoints, we can develop a set of collaborative processes, along with a supporting \norganization and infrastructure, which will foster reuse on an enterprise level. Laura Hill is Vice President \nqf Object Technology for Global Markets at JP Morgan in New York, and has been involved with Object- \nOriented Technology on Wall Street for the past 6 years, where she has been responsible for the institution \nand management of 00 based reuse, technology transferandproject migration programs. She has an MS in \nPhysics,fi-om M.1. T 102  Randall Smith Reuse of User Interface Today s user interfaces favor the direct \nmanipulation of objects paradigm, letting users reuse intuitions acquired from a lifetime in the physical \nworld. But how reusable is the physical world itself? Of course sometimes it s tricky to take physical \nobjects apart or to reassemble them, but sometimes it is quite easy. A brief story: The horizontal rectangular \ntube part of a towel rack at home was prone to slip out of its end holders and clatter to the floor. \nHaving finally become fed up two days ago, I ripped into a Coke can with my tin snips and made a rectangular \nshape to slip on the end of the tube, extending its length. Works great! Neither the towel rack designer \nnor the Coke can designer had to anticipate my reuse of their objects. Direct manipulation reusability \nlike this is just built into the nature of the objects around us. On balance, I claim the real world \nis more reusable than most software, and we would do well to emulate the physical world s reusability. \nHere are three aspects of physical systems that are key to enabling its reusability. 1. Everything is \navailable. No matter where you go, it s just more physical objects obeying the same old laws of physics. \n2. No edit mode. The laws of physics keep right on running, even while you make new kinds of furniture, \nclothing accessories, or other items. 3. It is fundamentally impossible to crash the system. No matter \nhow badly you abuse the arrangement of physical objects, the laws of physics just keep chugging along. \n I will talk about lessons learned from efforts to design this kind of direct-manipulation reuse and \nrobustness into software objects, primarily the objects of Self -a pure 00 language and programming environment. \nRandall B.
