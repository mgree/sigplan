This is due to the potential applications of such decision procedures to mechanical reasoning about correctness of concurrent programs. We show that there exist Temporal Logics that are (<italic>i</italic>) decidable in polynomial time, and (<italic>ii</italic>) still useful in applications. One surprising corollary of our results is that the fragment of CTL (Computation Tree Logic) actually used by Emerson &amp; Clarke [EC82] to synthesize concurrent programs from temporal specifications is decidable in polynomial time. Another is that the verification of many correctness properties of concurrent programs (such as in Owicki &amp; Lamport [OL82]) can be efficiently automated. This demonstrates that many useful correctness properties can be expressed with a rather restricted syntax. Finally, our results provide insight into the relation between the structural (i.e., syntactic) complexity of temporal logics and the complexity of their decision problems.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "E.
