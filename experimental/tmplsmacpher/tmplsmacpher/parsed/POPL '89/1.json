We present a graph rewriting semantics for program dependence graphs and prove the equivalence between the program dependence graphs semantics and the operational semantics for programs. We then propose a framework for studying program transformations using program dependence graphs and a programming language calculus based on this rewriting semantics.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "R.
