An important advantage of these synthesis methods is that they obviate the need to manually compose a program and manually construct a proof of its correctness. One only has to formulate a precise problem specification; the synthesis method then mechanically constructs a correct solution. A serious drawback of these methods in practice, however, is that they suffer from the state explosion problem. To synthesize a concurrent system consisting of <italic>K</italic> sequential processes, each having <italic>N</italic> states in its local transition diagram, requires construction of the global product-machine having at least <italic>N<supscrpt>K</supscrpt></italic> global states in general. This exponential growth in <italic>K</italic> makes it infeasible to synthesize systems composed of more than 2 or 3 processes. In this paper, we show how to synthesize concurrent systems consisting of many (i.e., a finite but arbitrarily large number <italic>K</italic> of) similar sequential processes. Our approach avoids construction of the global product-machine for <italic>K</italic> processes; instead, it constructs a two process product-machine for a single pair of generic sequential processes. The method is uniform in <italic>K</italic>, providing a simple template that can be instantiated for each process to yield a solution for any fixed <italic>K</italic>. The method is also illustrated on synchronization problems from the literature.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "P. C.
