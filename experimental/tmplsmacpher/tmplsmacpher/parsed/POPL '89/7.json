The extracted programs are terms of the Calculus that do not contain dependent types. We introduce a distinction between informative and non-informative propositions. This distinction allows the removal of the &#8220;logical&#8221; part in the development of a program. We show also how to use our notion of realizability in order to interpret various axioms like the axiom of choice or the induction on integers. A practical example of development of program is given in the appendix.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "C.
