By using probabilistic transition systems as the underlying semantic model, we show how a testing algorithm with a probability arbitrary close to 1 can distinguish processes that are not bisimulation equivalent. We also show a similar result (in a slightly stronger form) for a new process relation called 2/3-bisimulation &#8212; lying strictly between that of simulation and bisimulation. Finally, the ultimately strength of the testing language is shown to identify an even stronger process relation, called probabilistic bisimulation.</p>", "authors": [{"name": "K. G.
