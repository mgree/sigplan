# Structure

The `analysis` directory holds the R scripts we used to generate
figures for the
[paper](http://www.cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/snapl2015.pdf).

The `lda` directory holds the Python and bash scripts we used to run
David Blei's [LDA-C](https://github.com/Blei-Lab/lda-c). Outputs get
put in the `out` directory.

The `sessions` directory is the (not quite finished) analysis of
session data for POPL.

The `www` directory is the website frontend and backend.

# TODO

Oh the things that we will do!

## Server migration

We need to migrate the server away from Michael's hosting and to
something more permanent at Princeton.

## Sessions analysis
